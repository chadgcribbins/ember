# Western Academy of Beijing (WAB) Research Notes
*Prepared for: Fella*  
*Date: 2026-02-16*

## Why this school likely matches what you heard
The “Western Academy of Beijing” (WAB) is a well known not-for-profit international K-12 school in Beijing that has publicly documented two things that match your description:

1) A deliberate, research-driven redesign of learning environments (not just a nice campus).  
2) A visible, schoolwide stance on how to use AI and generative AI in learning, including guidance for different audiences (students, parents, faculty).

## Part 1: Learning environment design (spaces as pedagogy)

### 1) The headline idea: “Learning landscapes” instead of “classrooms”
Rosan Bosch Studio describes WAB’s prototype areas as replacing traditional classrooms with an “open community structure” that is meant to increase student agency and support project-based learning.  
Source: Rosan Bosch Studio project page (2019 prototype areas).

What to take away:
- The space is designed as a flexible ecosystem with multiple zones rather than a single room with desks.
- The design intent is to enable different learning modes that can change hour to hour.

### 2) Explicit link to IB Theory of Knowledge (ToK) and “Areas of Knowledge”
Rosan Bosch Studio states that the design strategy takes inspiration from the IB program’s Theory of Knowledge, and that environments are themed by “Areas of Knowledge” (example given: a mathematics community in middle school, and a multidisciplinary library in high school).

What to take away:
- This is not “pretty interior design.” It attempts to physically encode a curricular philosophy into spatial choices.
- The themeing gives shared language, cues, and rituals that can reinforce learning behaviors.

### 3) Ten differentiated space types inside each landscape
Rosan Bosch lists “ten differentiated spaces” that support different ways of working. It names the frameworks as:
- Movement
- Construction
- Stillness
- Sound
- Lab
- Bio
- Theatre
- Library
- Writing & Drawing
- Exhibition & Lounge Courtyard

What to take away:
- WAB’s redesign treats learning as a sequence of modes, not a single mode.
- Those modes can be mapped to timetable decisions, teacher moves, and student self-management.

### 4) Operational targets: team-teaching, flexible grouping, mentorship, individualized timetables
Rosan Bosch describes the design supporting WAB’s “FLoW21 targets,” naming:
- Team-teaching
- Flexible learning groups
- Mentorship
- Individualized timetables

What to take away:
- These are organizational changes, not only design changes. The space is a forcing function for staffing models and scheduling practices.

### 5) Cultural identity integrated into wayfinding and “place”
Rosan Bosch notes the use of Chinese cultural motifs in a modern framework, including:
- Dragon paths
- Moon gates
- Courtyard structures

What to take away:
- This aims to create a strong sense of place and belonging while remaining future-facing.
- For international schools, it is a model for local cultural integration without becoming “theme park China.”

### 6) External validation and documentation
ArchDaily (published 2020-02-21) documents the project and repeats the key story: learning landscapes themed by areas of knowledge, and multiple differentiated spaces that support flexible learning.  
Architect Magazine also lists Rosan Bosch Studio as the architect/designer for the project gallery entry (completed 2019).

## Part 2: WAB’s framing of innovation and future-ready learning

### “Big I” vs “little i” innovation
WAB’s innovation page describes innovation as both:
- “Big I”: structured, intentional changes like new learning spaces or new courses
- “little i”: continuous everyday tweaks and iteration inside classrooms

Why it matters:
- It describes innovation as a culture, not an annual initiative.
- It gives permission for staff to iterate, not only comply.

### Global affiliations that shape measurement and credentials
WAB’s innovation page lists participation/partnership references including:
- IB
- NEASC
- Council of International Schools (CIS)
- University of Melbourne “Melbourne Metrics”
- Mastery Transcript Consortium

Why it matters:
- This signals that WAB is aligning with competency-based and future-ready credential thinking, not only standard transcripts.

## Part 3: What WAB appears to be doing with AI and education

### 1) “AI hub” as a community resource (students, parents, faculty)
WAB hosts an AI section on “WAB Learns” that is described as community guides supporting “adaptation and innovation” in the rapidly developing world of Generative AI.  
Source: https://learn.wab.edu/innovation/ai/ai

Even from the public snippets and index pages, the structure signals an approach that is:
- Audience-specific (students, parents, faculty)
- Practical (tools and workflows)
- Values-led (ethics, transparency, integrity)

### 2) An explicit AI ethics posture: transparency, accuracy, learning first
AmCham China reports that WAB developed an AI ethics code that prioritizes transparency and learning, and encourages responsible engagement with AI tools. It also notes WAB’s stance that AI should enhance, not replace, critical thinking and human interaction.

### 3) Tool choices that map to real classroom needs
AmCham China names tools WAB uses (or has used in practice) such as:
- MagicSchool
- Diffit

Source: AmCham China article above.

Additionally, WAB Learns “AI for Faculty: Inclusion” (snippet dated 2026-02-03) explicitly lists:
- Canva “Magic” AI tools (including Magic Translate)
- Diffit (differentiation and resources)
- UDL (Universal Design for Learning) positioning for inclusion and language learning support

Source: https://learn.wab.edu/innovation/ai/faculty/inclusion

### 4) AI literacy as scope and sequence (not just “workshops”)
WAB Learns “AI for Faculty: Integrity & IB” (snippet dated 2026-02-03) references a “scope and sequence” for developing AI literacy across grade levels.  
Source: https://learn.wab.edu/innovation/ai/faculty/integrity

Interpretation:
- This looks closer to “curriculum integration” than ad hoc experimentation.
- It suggests alignment with assessment integrity and IB expectations.

### 5) Hands-on student experiences: AI, robotics, and machine learning
WAB’s STEMX Science Day 2026 post describes student-led activities that include:
- Simulating an AI network (neural network and reinforcement learning)
- Robotics and applied AI using AI-powered “Raspbot cars” with examples like gesture following and color tracking, and navigating a maze

### 6) Leadership signaling: “WAB is Ready for AI”
WAB’s podcast episode (2023-02-23) is titled “Artificial Intelligence in Education - WAB is Ready for AI,” featuring their Director of Innovation in Learning & Teaching describing WAB’s approach and community readiness.

## Part 4: Transferable concepts you could reuse when thinking about “school by design”

### A. Design principles for learning environments
Use WAB as a case study for principles like:
1) **Multiple learning modes** in one zone (movement, stillness, making, presenting).
2) **Space as a schedule tool** (supports mentorship, flexible grouping, individualized timetables).
3) **Visible learning** (exhibitions, public artifacts, learning on display).
4) **Local cultural identity** embedded in details, not wallpaper.
5) **Pedagogy encoded in architecture** (ToK and “Areas of Knowledge” as design logic).

### B. Design principles for AI in education
WAB’s public posture suggests principles like:
1) **Transparency**: disclose when and how AI was used, and why.
2) **Accuracy discipline**: verify and cite sources, treat AI output as draft.
3) **Learning-first**: use AI to support thinking, not replace it.
4) **Audience-specific enablement**: separate guidance for students, parents, and faculty.
5) **Inclusion and accessibility**: use AI for translation, differentiation, and UDL support.
6) **Curriculum-level AI literacy**: a scope and sequence, not only a toolkit page.

## Part 5: Practical next steps (if you want to go further)
1) **Pull the “Learning landscapes” vocabulary into your own internal model**, and map it to the behaviors you want in a school (agency, collaboration, reflection, making, presenting).  
2) **Draft a one-page “AI learning charter”** for a school community using WAB-style values: transparency, integrity, accuracy, and learning-first.  
3) **Audit your current spaces against the 10-mode list**, and identify which modes you support well, and which ones are missing (often “movement” and “exhibition” are weak).  
4) **Look for evidence of AI scope and sequence**: even a lightweight progression by age band can reduce chaos and integrity concerns.  
5) **Identify 2 to 3 use cases that genuinely save teacher time** (differentiation, translation, feedback scaffolds), then wrap them in training and guardrails.
