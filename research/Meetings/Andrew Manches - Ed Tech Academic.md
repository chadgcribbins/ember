### Chad’s Educational Background and Current Situation

- Daughter’s traumatic experience at London middle school
  - Philosophy: “break the kids down to build them up sort of a thing”
  - Normal run-of-the-mill school, not special program - Chad invested significantly in getting right catchment area
  - Moved daughter from previous school specifically to access feeder system for target school
  - Seventh grade crisis (age 12-13): daughter developed “dark thoughts,” required professional counseling
  - School’s rigid approach created crippling test anxiety
    - Daughter: naturally poor test-taker with “crippling fear” during examinations
    - Performs excellently throughout year with positive parent-teacher feedback
    - Testing environment causes complete freeze-up and failure
  - Catastrophic assessment failure and systemic gaming
    - Scored 4 out of 40 on critical exam, devastating c
    onfidence
    - Automatic demotion from top academic set to bottom set with non-readers
    - Daughter’s self-doubt: “Am I that dumb?” Chad’s response: “No baby, you’re a shit test-taker, but you’re not dumb”
    - School’s perverse incentives: kept high-performing students in low sets to artificially boost Ofsted comparison scores
    - Rigged testing-out process: school changed requirements mid-attempt (moved from one test to two tests required)
    - Missed promotion by only 2 points, school refused flexibility despite clear academic ability
  - Demographic and institutional dysfunction
    - School historically “in trouble,” implemented harsh tactics that never evolved
    - Hackney borough transformed over 20 years but school methods remained static
    - Ofsted scores trending positive through rigid scripting leaving “very little room for mistake”
    - Students avoid risks, focus purely on achieving prescribed outcomes rather than learning
    - Heavy testing focus driving “all the stuff that drives you nuts”
- Transformation at Artemis Lisbon International School
  - Founded by Grinda, part of global Artemis network opening first year
  - Two months in: daughter declared “Papa, that’s the greatest week at school I’ve had in my entire life” - statement nearly brought Chad to tears
  - Proactive educational support without parental prompting
    - Unsolicited comprehensive 20-page assessment identifying specific learning challenges
    - Detailed page-by-page walkthrough with parents explaining memory processing issues
    - Immediate implementation of targeted interventions and accommodation strategies
    - Contrast with London school’s dismissive “that’s nothing” response to Chad’s concerns
  - Cultural philosophy transformation
    - Mission: “creating good human beings” rather than test performance optimization
    - Cambridge curriculum foundation with IB upper levels, but flexible implementation
    - Teachers empowered to adapt curriculum direction based on student needs
    - “First principles learning and good judgment” prioritized over test preparation skills
    - Test preparation acknowledged as necessary but treated as secondary technical skill
  - Innovation adoption and teacher enthusiasm
    - Chad introduced Whisper Flow (speech-to-text AI tool) to teaching staff
    - Instead of bureaucratic resistance (“not on approved software list”), immediate excitement
    - Teachers spontaneously identified applications for autistic students with communication challenges
    - Staff demonstrated curiosity about leveraging tools to “better serve these kids in a way that’s healthy”
- Chad’s personal educational parallel and redemption story
  - Childhood vision impairment: amblyopia requiring eye patch treatment to strengthen weak eye
  - Cruel teacher deliberately seated him in back row despite vision limitations
  - Public humiliation when unable to answer questions about board content he couldn’t see
  - Rescue intervention: grandparents arrived unannounced, packed belongings in garbage bag
  - “We’re taking Chaddy. Bye.” - immediate extraction from toxic environment
  - Oregon rural school transformation
    - “One-horse town” with tiny school, only two teachers for entire institution
    - Asymmetric peer teaching model: “older kids taught younger, younger taught older kids”
    - Self-paced learning with weekly, monthly, and term-based goal structures
    - Personal outcome: “That school probably saved my life. I’d probably be pumping gas if it wasn’t for that school”
    - Formative experience now informing AI education vision: “massively scalable” version of personalized learning

    - Data sovereignty issues: US-based tools with American data storage not compliant
    - Specific risk: voice/speech data collection for AI model training under heightened scrutiny
  - Emerging European AI Act implications
    - New regulations specifically addressing AI usage with children’s data
    - Questions raised about children using voice-interactive AI systems
    - Regulatory tension: “barriers for innovation, but to others is children’s rights and stuff like that”
    - Compliance requirement for children’s AI interaction protocols
- Pedagogical implementation barriers and success factors
  - Traditional institutional resistance patterns (from Andrew’s Becta research)
    - Leadership skepticism (solved at Artemis)
    - Teacher confidence and training gaps (addressed through selective hiring)
    - Curriculum alignment pressures (managed through flexible Cambridge framework)
    - Parent expectations and acceptance (private school context provides flexibility)
  - Assessment methodology tensions and measurement challenges
    - Core tension: “productive tension between sort of learning scientists and educators”
    - Educator pressure: “remit, get the kids. And there’s other metrics”
    - Andrew’s diagnostic question to Chad: “If you had a choice between two AI systems. One, kids are sort of happy, but they get ace results. Another one, kids are extremely happy, but it’s not quite there. Which is more important?”
    - Chad’s clear response: “Two. So with everybody in the school, number two” (prioritizing happiness)
    - Measurement challenge: how to capture qualitative outcomes like “that’s the best week ever” in systematic way
    - Happiness metrics development: “How do you capture this is the best experience. How do you capture? Children feel confident in the world, they feel optimistic in the world”
- AI dependency and learning transfer risks
  - Research evidence: “A lot of the AI are great, but then you take the AI away and students are really lost”
  - Skill transfer challenge: ensuring AI-supported learning generalizes to independent capability
  - Neuroscience concerns: “Well published negative critique of how students’ brains didn’t activate as much”
  - Andrew’s measured assessment: “If you actually unpack the detail, it’s not really it’s not there’s a lot of bad science out there as well to navigate”
- Rich tasks and problem-based learning integration opportunities
  - Pedagogical approach: shift from traditional subject silos to integrated problem-solving
  - Real-world application: “Real world stuff much more about problems than maths”
  - Technology synergy: AI systems naturally support interdisciplinary problem-solving approaches
  - University preparation: developing meta-cognitive skills for “learning with an AI” vs independent learning
