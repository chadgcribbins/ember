# Two Hour Learning — Alpha School

*Video transcript — Mackenzie Price, Co-founder of Two Hour Learning*

## Introduction

Traditional school is broken. It's outdated, full of busy work, and sadly for our kids, often a waste of time. But what if I told you there's a school where students focused on academics for only two hours a day, but still easily outperformed their peers in traditional school? And what if I told you the school has no teachers? And students learn academics through an AI tutor, on AI apps that give each student a one-to-one personalized mastery-based academic journey. They guarantee success.

My name is **Mackenzie Price** and I'm the co-founder of **Two Hour Learning**, a revolutionary new learning model that is transforming education as we know it. In the next few minutes, I'm going to dive into this concept of Two Hour Learning, showing you how it works and the academic results you can expect. We are going to use data from **Alpha School**, the flagship campus that first implemented Two Hour Learning.

> At Alpha, we commit to parents that their child will learn twice as much in two hours per day as they would in six hours of traditional school.

## Disclaimers

Before we begin, two important disclaimers:

1. **This is not a magic software solution.** We believe edtech is only 10% of the solution while 90% is having a motivated student. We don't have academic teachers — instead, we have **guides** who spend their day motivating and supporting students as they become self-driven learners. The other key to motivation is giving students their most valuable resource back: **time**. They spend only two hours doing academics; the rest of the school day is spent developing life skills — leadership, teamwork, public speaking, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and socialization through engaging active workshops.

2. **This system doesn't work for everyone.** We find it works great for 80-90% of kids.

## Results

### Standardized Test Scores (MAP)

MAP is a nationwide standardized test that millions of students take. This is the third-party test we tell parents to use to hold us accountable for K-8. We use SAT and Advanced Placement tests for high school.

**2023-24 school year, grades K-8:** If you look at the spring achievement column (which measures how much a student knows), most of our classes are in the **top 1%** for every subject. Amazing results for a school with no academic teachers.

### Measuring 2x Learning

We use MAP as our third-party grader. MAP measures how much students learn each year. At Alpha, we double those scores:

| Example | Standard Growth | Alpha Growth |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| 50th percentile 5th grader (math) | 4 points/year | 8 points/year |
| 99th percentile 7th grader | 7 points/year | 14 points/year |

### Results by Cohort

- **Average student:** just over 2x learning
- **Top two-thirds:** 2.6x average
- **Top 20%:** almost 4x faster learning

### Advanced Students

We chart students' age-grade level versus their knowledge-grade level (as determined by MAP). We put the student in the highest knowledge grade where they're still in the top 10% nationally. These results are unbelievable to most parents. All we can say is: **your child is capable of so much more than they are doing.** With an AI tutor, students can move as fast as they are capable of learning. The sky is the limit.

### Students Who Are Behind

Our model excels at taking children who are behind and enabling them to catch up. A group of seven boys who were two years behind:
- Learned **4.6x faster**
- Completed **two entire grade levels in six months**

### Low SES Students

Alpha has a campus in Brownsville, Texas — one of the poorest school districts in the country. Our low SES students learn **2.1x faster**.

> Here's the thing about an AI tutor. It doesn't care if a student is white, black, or brown. It doesn't care if a student is rich or poor. It doesn't care if a student is in the 15th percentile or the 85th percentile. It is infinitely patient.

### Kindergarten

When we started Alpha, we didn't have a kindergarten class because we thought they were too young to learn via apps. We were wrong. Almost all kindergarten students are in the **top 1%**, both in how much they know and how fast they're learning.

### High School

These are our students who have been using Two Hour Learning the longest — in some cases, they haven't had an academic teacher in 10 years.

- **Average SAT score:** 1470
- **90% of students** get 4s or 5s on APs
- First graduating class (12 students) accepted at: Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, UCL London, NYU Shanghai, UT Austin, Howard University, Northeastern, and FIT
- Half were **National Merit Scholars** or Commended Scholars
- Five were **AP Scholars with Distinction** (highest honor)

### Time Spent

Average academic time: **less than two hours per day**. Some students are over two hours (either catching up or getting way ahead), but not one is over three.

## Why and How It Works

> **Disclaimer:** This has been a process we've been working through for 10 years since our first school opened in 2014. We present it as super crisp and clean, but it's a messy process. We tell parents to expect results, not polish.

### The Learning Science Foundation

Thousands of learning science papers describe how students can learn 2x, 5x, 10x faster. **Benjamin Bloom's Two Sigma Problem** is a seminal paper from 40 years ago. Unfortunately, all of these papers start or end with: *"This doesn't work in a standard teacher-in-front-of-a-classroom model."*

**This is the core of how we work: you have to take the teacher in front of the classroom out.** No one has ever been willing to do this before.

### Example 1: Individualized Tutoring & Learning Plans

80% of a standard school classroom (especially post-COVID) does not have the same background knowledge. Some students are behind, some at grade level, some ahead. A teacher can't possibly give individual lessons to each kid with 20+ students — **but an AI tutor can**.

Example: A new eighth grader joined who was behind academically. If we put her in eighth-grade material based on her age, it's going to be too hard. Instead, the AI tutor assessed where she should be and put her in **fifth-grade material**. Putting a student in the right level instills confidence and shows they have the ability to learn. By the end of her first year at Alpha, she was academically ready for high school — saving years of struggle.

### Example 2: Mastery Learning

Mastery learning means: don't put students in material that's over their head. Master the basics before doing the advanced. This requires giving the student as much time as needed before moving on.

A standard teacher can't handle that — they have to follow a lesson plan, moving on to new concepts as the year progresses. This leads to students who only understand 70-75% of the material being pushed into advanced lessons where they get stuck and discouraged.

> If you can only get 70% of division problems correct, you're going to really struggle in fractions.

## The Tactical Details

### How Long Does It Take to Learn a Subject?

| Grade/Subject | Lessons | Avg. Time per Lesson | Total Hours |
|---------------|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| 3rd Grade Language | ~100 | 16 min | 40 hrs |

Why 40 hours instead of 25? When students get stuck, the **AI struggle detector** gives them easier lessons to work through stuck points. Plus some days students aren't focused. But on average, they can finish an entire grade level in 40 hours.

**Breakdown:**
- At 30 min sessions → 80 days to finish a grade
- 180 school days in a year → need to finish in 90 days for 2x
- 80 days fits comfortably, even with test days and absences

### When It Doesn't Work

1. **Missing foundational math facts** — if they haven't memorized addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables, they can't learn in two hours. The fastest way forward is sometimes to go back.
2. **Student doesn't engage with the app** — refuses to use it or uses it incorrectly (e.g., typing "DDDDD" into math answers). This is a motivation problem, which is what guides address all day.
3. **Parents not philosophically aligned** — if parents aren't supportive of the model, it causes issues with student engagement. Parents need to get educated about how it works and see results.

### The 120-Minute Structure

Using the **Pomodoro technique** — four sessions of 25 minutes each:

1. **Math** (25 min)
2. **Science & Social Science** (25 min)
3. **Language & Writing** (25 min)
4. **Reading** (25 min)

Additional 20 minutes: predominantly math, plus learn-to-learn skills, test-taking strategies, and depth-of-knowledge exercises. There are breaks including recess within the two hours.

### The Student Dashboard ("Dash")

Students log into **Dash**, where they can see:
- **Jenga Tower** — visual representation of lessons learned and remaining in each subject
- **Long-term goals** and the daily goals needed to achieve them
- **Daily rings** — showing whether daily work is complete

Parents also have access.

### The Parent Learning Plan

The detailed learning plan available to each parent includes:

**Student Profile:**
- Age grade vs. knowledge grade
- Lessons completed and remaining per grade level
- Weeks to finish at current pace
- Weeks to finish with one extra hour per day

**Test Results:**
- MAP percentile achievement (how much they know)
- MAP percentile growth (how fast they're learning)
- Times growth vs. traditional school (target: 2x)
- State standardized tests (STAAR in Texas, FAST in Florida)
- Students must score **90%** to finish a grade level — far higher than state requirements

**Learning Efficiency:**
- **Minutes per day** per subject (target: 25 min each)
- **Accuracy** — above 95% means material is too easy; below 70% means too hard or guessing
- **Waste meter** — percent of time wasted (not at computer, typing random answers, not reading explanations, rapidly guessing). Students spending more than 2 hours often have waste scores above 50%.
