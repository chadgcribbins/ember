# Ember - TODO

## Notion Resource Guide
- [ ] Add headshots for all people in People & Network page (consider converting to Notion database with gallery view for cleaner presentation)

## Vision Sharpening
- [ ] Revisit the vision language - key threads to explore:
  - Ember as an **OS that schools run on**, not a school brand (Lisboan doesn't become Ember, it runs on Ember). Platform vs. product framing. BGA's hub network as ready-made distribution.
  - The afternoon half is the novel piece - AI-powered human development (wellbeing, creativity, EQ), not just "stuff that isn't academics." Silja (gamified mental health), Sebastian (sonic AI/biofeedback), Joanna (human development) suggest this is already the intuition.
  - The OS orchestrates **both halves** of the day - knows where every child is academically *and* emotionally, helps human guides make better decisions.
  - "Happiness over results" isn't a soft answer, it's a **design principle** that differentiates from Alpha (who optimise for MAP scores).
  - European values as a genuine differentiator, not just GDPR compliance.
  - The hard question: **how do you measure "unlocking potential"?** Mastery velocity is easy. Confidence, agency, spark - that's where Andrew's academic partnership becomes essential.
  - Draft vision to riff on: *"Ember is an AI-native education operating system that orchestrates the relationship between child, mentor, and machine. It compresses core academics into a 2-hour daily mastery block through personalised AI tutoring - freeing the rest of the school day for what actually matters: creativity, collaboration, emotional intelligence, and discovering what makes each child come alive. Built in Europe, for European values. Evidence-led from day one. Human mentorship at the centre, AI as the amplifier - never the authority."*
