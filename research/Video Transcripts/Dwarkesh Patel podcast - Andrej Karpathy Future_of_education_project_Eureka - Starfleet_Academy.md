## Why Education Over AI Research

**Dwarkesh Patel:** So let's talk about education in Eureka and stuff. One thing you could do is start another AI lab and then try to solve those problems. You're curious what you're up to now. And then yeah, why not AI research itself?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I guess maybe the way I would put it is I feel some amount of determinism around the things that AI labs are doing. And I feel like I could help out there, but I don't know that I would uniquely improve it. But I think my personal big fear is that a lot of the stuff happens on the side of humanity and that humanity gets disempowered by it. And I care not just about all the things that AI is going to build in a fully autonomous way. I care about what happens to humans and I want humans to be well off in this future.

And I feel like that's where I can add a lot more unique value than like an incremental improvement in the frontier lab. And so I guess I'm most afraid of something maybe like the picture in movies like Wall-E or Idiocracy or something like that where humanity is sort of on the side of this stuff. And I want humans to be much, much better in this future. And so I guess to me, this is kind of like through education that you can actually achieve this.

## Building Starfleet Academy

**Dwarkesh Patel:** And so what are you working on there?

**Andrej Karpathy:** So Eureka is trying to build — I think maybe the easiest way I can describe it is we're trying to build the Starfleet Academy. I don't know if you watch Star Trek.

**Dwarkesh Patel:** I haven't.

**Andrej Karpathy:** Starfleet Academy is this elite institution for frontier technology, building spaceships and graduating cadets to be in the pilots of these spaces. So I just imagine an elite institution for technical knowledge and basically a kind of school that's very up to date and very much a premier institution.

## How Education Must Change With AI

**Dwarkesh Patel:** A category of questions I have for you is just explaining how one teaches technical or scientific content. Well, because you are one of the world masters at it. And then I'm curious both about how you think about it for content you already put out there on YouTube, but also to the extent it's any different, how do you think about it for Eureka?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I think one thing that is very fascinating to me about education is I do think education will pretty fundamentally change with AI on the side. And I think it has to be rewired and changed to some extent. I still think that we're pretty early. I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to try to do the obvious things which is like, oh, have an LLM and ask it questions and get, you know, do all the basic things that you would do via prompting right now. I think it's helpful, but it still feels to me a bit like slop.

I would like to do it properly and I think the capability is not there for what I would want. What I'd want is like an actual tutor experience.

## The Korean Tutor Experience

**Andrej Karpathy:** Maybe a prominent example in my mind is I was recently learning Korean. I went through a phase where I was learning Korean by myself on the internet. I went through a phase where I was actually part of a small class in Korea, taking Korean with a bunch of other people which was really funny. But we had a teacher and like 10 people taking Korean. And then I switched to a 1:1 tutor.

And I guess what was fascinating to me is I think I had a really good tutor. She instantly from a very short conversation understood where I am as a student, what I know and don't know. And she was able to probe exactly the kinds of questions to understand my world model. No LLM will do that for you 100% right now, not even close. But a tutor will do that if they're good.

Once she understands, she actually really served me all the things that I needed at my current sliver of capability. I need to be always appropriately challenged. I can't be faced with something too hard or too trivial. And a tutor is really good at serving you just the right stuff.

So basically I felt like I was the only constraint to learning. I was always given the perfect information. It's not that I can't find knowledge or it's not properly explained. It's just my ability to memorize and so on. And this is what I want for people.

## Timing and Current Capability

**Dwarkesh Patel:** How do you automate that?

**Andrej Karpathy:** Very good question. At the current capability, you don't. But I do think that it's not actually the right time to build this kind of an AI tutor. I still think it's a useful product and lots of people will build it. But the bar is so high and the capability is not there.

Even today I would say ChatGPT is an extremely valuable educational product. But for me, it was so fascinating to see how high the bar is. And when I was with her, I almost felt like there's no way I can build this.

**Dwarkesh Patel:** But you're building it right? Anyone who's had a really good tutor is like, how are you going to build this?

**Andrej Karpathy:** So I'm waiting for that capability. A lot of my times the value that I brought to companies was telling them not to use AI. It wasn't like I was the AI expert and they described the problem. I said, don't use AI. This was my value. And I feel like it's the same in education right now — for what I have in mind, it's not yet the time, but the time will come. And for now, I'm building something that looks maybe a bit more conventional. That has a physical and digital component.

## Building the First Course

**Dwarkesh Patel:** What is the thing you hope will be released this year or next year?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I'm building the first course and I want to have a really, really good course. State of the art, obvious state of the art destination you go to learn AI, because that's just what I'm familiar with. And Nanachat, which you briefly mentioned, is a capstone project of LLM101N, which is a class that I'm building. So that's a really big piece of it, but now I have to build out a lot of the intermediates and then actually hire a small team of TAs and build the entire course.

## Eureka's Per Second — Building Ramps to Knowledge

**Andrej Karpathy:** Many times when people think about education, they think about the softer component of diffusing knowledge. But I actually have something very hard and technical in mind. In my mind, education is the very difficult technical process of **building ramps to knowledge**.

Nanachat is a ramp to knowledge because it's a very simplified full stack thing. If you give this artifact to someone and they look through it, they're learning a ton of stuff. And so it's giving you a lot of what I call **Eureka's per second**, which is understanding per second. That's what I want. Lots of Eureka's per second.

To me, this is a technical problem of how do we build these ramps? I almost think of Eureka as not that different from frontier labs, because I want to figure out how to build these ramps very efficiently so that people are never stuck. Everything is always not too hard or not too trivial. And you have just the right material to actually progress.

## AI's Role in Course Creation

**Dwarkesh Patel:** It sounds like the automation or AI is actually not as significant. The big offer is your ability to explain AI, hardified in the source material of the class?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I think you always have to be calibrated to what capability is in the industry. Right now, if you go to ChatGPT and say "teach me AI," it's going to give you some slop. AI is never going to write Nanachat right now, but Nanachat is a really useful intermediate point. I'm collaborating with AI to create all this material.

Earlier on, I built CS231N at Stanford, which was one of the first deep learning classes at Stanford. The difference in building CS231N and LLM101N now is quite stark. Not because I feel really empowered by the LLMs as they exist right now, but I'm very much in the loop. They're helping me build the materials, I go much faster. They're doing a lot of boring stuff. But it's not yet at a place where they can creatively create the content. I'm still there to do that.

## Physical vs. Digital Offering

**Andrej Karpathy:** I will hire faculty, because there are domains in which I'm not an expert. But when I'm building Starfleet Academy, I do probably imagine a physical institution and maybe a tier below that, a digital offering that is not the state of the art experience. You would get the state of the art when someone comes in physically full time and we work through material from start to end. The digital offering is a bunch of stuff on the internet with maybe some element of AI assistance — a tier below, but at least it's accessible to eight billion people.

## Pre-AGI vs. Post-AGI Education

**Dwarkesh Patel:** You're basically inventing college from first principles for the tools that are available today.

**Andrej Karpathy:** Yeah, and I think there's going to have to be a lot of not just education, but also re-education. For example, today a lot of people are trying to upskill in AI specifically. I think motivation-wise, before AGI, motivation is very simple to solve because people want to make money.

I think post-AGI is a lot more interesting, because if everything is automated and there's nothing to do for anyone, why would anyone go to a school? I often say that **pre-AGI education is useful, post-AGI education is fun**.

In a similar way, people go to the gym today, but we don't need their physical strength to manipulate heavy objects. They still go to gym. Why? Because it's fun, it's healthy, and you look hot when you have a six-pack.

I think education will play out the same way — you'll go to school like you go to gym. Right now, not that many people learn because learning is hard. You bounce from material. But I think it's a technical problem to solve. It's a technical problem to do what my tutor did for me when I was learning Korean. I think it's tractable and buildable. And when you actually do it properly, learning feels good. People will do it for the same reason they go to gym.

## Cognitive Olympics

**Dwarkesh Patel:** That sounds different from using this supposed AGI as entertainment or self-betterment. You had a vision that this education is relevant to keeping humanity in control of AI.

**Andrej Karpathy:** I do think people can go so far. We barely scratch the surface of what a person can go. People are bouncing off of material that's too easy or too hard. I feel that people will be able to go much further — like anyone speaks five languages because why not? Because it's so trivial. Anyone knows all the basic curriculum.

**Dwarkesh Patel:** I think it has a perfect analog in gym culture. A hundred years ago nobody would be ripped. Nobody would be able to spontaneously bench press three plates. It's actually very common now. You're imagining similar things — learning across very many different domains, intensely, deeply, faster.

**Andrej Karpathy:** Exactly. I'm betting a little bit implicitly on some of the timelessness of human nature. If you look at, for example, aristocrats or ancient Greece — whenever you had little pocket environments that were post-AGI in a certain sense, people spent a lot of their time flourishing.

Maybe it's even going to become a sport. Right now you have powerlifters who go extreme. So what is powerlifting in a cognitive era? Maybe it's people who are really trying to make Olympics out of knowing stuff. And if you have a perfect AI tutor, maybe you can get extremely far. The geniuses of today barely scratch the surface of what a human mind can do.

## The Art of Teaching

**Dwarkesh Patel:** If you had to give advice to another educator in another field to make the kinds of YouTube tutorials you've made, what advice would you give them?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I think a lot of this comes from my physics background. I really enjoyed my physics background. Everyone should learn physics in early school education. Because early school education is not about accumulating knowledge for tasks later. It's about **booting up a brain**. And physics uniquely boots up the brain the best.

The idea of building models and abstractions and understanding that there are first-order approximations that describe most of the system, but then there's second-order, third-order terms. When a physicist walks into class and says "assuming there's a spherical cow" — everyone laughs, but it's actually brilliant thinking that's very generalizable.

Because of that training, I always try to find the first-order terms of everything. What actually matters? How can I simplify it? How can I have a simple thing that shows the core concept?

## Micrograd as a Teaching Example

**Andrej Karpathy:** Maybe an example from one of my repos is **micrograd**. It's 100 lines of code that shows backpropagation. You can create neural networks out of simple operations — plus and times — Lego blocks of neural networks. You build up a computational graph, do a forward pass and backward pass to get the gradients.

These 100 lines of Python are everything you need to understand how neural networks train. **Everything else is just efficiency.** You need your tensors, you lay them out, you stride them, make sure your kernels are orchestrating memory movement correctly. But the core intellectual piece of neural network training is micrograd.

I love finding these smaller terms and serving them on a platter. Education is the most intellectually interesting thing because you have a tangle of understanding and you're trying to lay it out in a way that creates a ramp where everything only depends on the thing before it.

## Teaching Techniques

**Dwarkesh Patel:** Your tutorial on the transformer begins with bigrams — literally a lookup table. Such a brilliant way to start, and each piece is motivated.

**Andrej Karpathy:** Yeah, you're presenting the pain before you present the solution. You want to take the student through that progression. There are a lot of small things like that. Always prompting the student — how would you solve this? I'm not going to present a solution before you're going to guess. That would be wasteful.

It's a bit of a dick move to present you with the solution before I give you a shot to come up with it yourself. Because if you try yourself, you get a better understanding of the action space and the objective. Then you maximize the amount of knowledge per fact added.

## The Curse of Knowledge

**Dwarkesh Patel:** Why do you think genuine experts in their field are often bad at explaining it?

**Andrej Karpathy:** It's the curse of knowledge and expertise. It's a real phenomenon. I suffered from it myself. You take certain things for granted and you can't see issues of people who are just starting out.

One thing that's extremely helpful: someone showed me a biology paper, and I had so many terrible questions. So I used ChatGPT to ask the questions with the paper in the context window. Then I shared the thread with the person who wrote the paper. If they can see the dumb questions I had, it might help them explain better.

For my material, I would love if people shared their dumb conversations with ChatGPT about the stuff I've created, because it helps me put myself in the shoes of someone starting out.

## Just Say the Thing

**Andrej Karpathy:** Another trick that works astoundingly well — if somebody writes a paper or blog post, it is 100% of the time true that the narration of how they would explain it to you over lunch is way more understandable, but actually also more accurate and scientific. People have a bias to explain things in the most abstract, jargon-filled way possible and to clear their throat for four paragraphs before they explain the central idea. But there's something about communicating one-on-one which compels you to just say the thing.

The most prominent example: back in my PhD days, you read someone's paper and work to understand it. Then you catch them at the conference having beers and ask "so what's the paper about?" And they give you three sentences that perfectly capture the essence. Why isn't that the paper?

## Learning Strategies

**Dwarkesh Patel:** What is your advice as a student? If you're reading a paper from somebody or reading a book, what strategies do you employ to learn material in fields you're not an expert in?

**Andrej Karpathy:** I don't actually know that I have unique tips and tricks. One thing that's always helped me: **learning things on demand** is pretty nice, learning depth-wise. You need alternation of learning depth-wise on demand — you're trying to achieve a certain project you're going to get a reward from — and learning breadth-wise, which is "trust me, you'll need this later."

I love the kind of learning where you actually get a reward of doing something and you're learning on demand. The other thing that's extremely helpful: **explaining things to people** is a beautiful way to learn something more deeply. I realize if I don't really understand something, I can't explain it. It forces you to come to terms with gaps and reconcile them.
