# Innovative K–12 Pedagogy and AI-Augmented Learning (Reading Pack)

Date: 18 Dec 2025

This is a curated, research-forward set of academic papers and high-signal sources aligned to a model that looks like:

- **Daily deep-focus mastery block** for core skills (self-paced, mastery-based, AI-supported).
- **Afternoons for collaborative projects**, creativity, curiosity, and real-world skills.
- **Deliberate EQ and SEL development**, so students become capable humans, not only good test-takers.

## 1) Deep focus, time-structuring, and “flow”

### Pomodoro and time-boxing
- **Ogut, E. (2025). _Assessing the efficacy of the Pomodoro technique in enhancing anatomy lesson retention during study sessions: a scoping review._ BMC Medical Education, 25, 1440.**
  - Why it matters: consolidates evidence that structured focus intervals plus breaks can reduce fatigue and improve sustained attention, a building block for “deep work” habits.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-025-08001-0

### Flow and creativity links
- **Wang, X., Somasundram, P., & Zhang, J. (2025). _The influence of flow experience on mathematical creativity among primary school students in China._ Frontiers in Education, 10.**
  - Why it matters: empirically connects classroom flow experiences with higher mathematical creativity, useful for designing “deep flow” blocks that also cultivate creative cognition.

## 2) Mastery learning, tutoring effects, and AI tutors

### AI tutor versus strong classroom instruction (RCT evidence)
- **Kestin, G., Miller, K., Klales, A., Milbourne, T., & Ponti, G. (2025). _AI tutoring outperforms in-class active learning: an RCT introducing a novel research-based design in an authentic educational setting._ Scientific Reports, 15.**
  - Why it matters: shows a carefully designed AI tutor can outperform a good active-learning classroom on learning gains and time-on-task in a controlled study, relevant to scaling mastery blocks.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-97652-6

### K–12 evidence base for intelligent tutoring systems (systematic review)
- **Létourneau, A., Deslandes Martineau, M., & Charland, P. (2025). _A systematic review of AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) in K–12 education._ npj Science of Learning, 10, 29.**
  - Why it matters: maps K–12 outcomes and study designs, highlights where evidence is strong, and where it is thin (duration, diversity, implementation realism).
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-025-00320-7

## 3) Project-based learning and creativity growth

- **Albar, S. B., & Southcott, J. E. (2021). _Problem and project-based learning through an investigation lesson: significant gains in creative thinking behaviour within the Australian foundation (preparatory) classroom._ Thinking Skills and Creativity, 41, 100853.**
  - Why it matters: classroom evidence that inquiry + projects can intensify creative thinking behaviours (exploration, experimentation, resilience), directly aligned with project afternoons.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2021.100853

## 4) Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and academic outcomes

- **Ha, C., et al. (2025). _Disentangling the Effects of Social and Emotional Learning Programs on Student Academic Achievement Across Grades 1–12: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis._ Review of Educational Research.**
  - Why it matters: high-level synthesis that SEL has measurable positive effects on achievement, supporting the case for baking EQ development into the core model.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.3102/00346543251367769

## 5) Creativity, “spark finding”, and enabling conditions

- **Smaré, Z., & Elfatihi, M. (2024). _A systematic review on factors influencing the development of children’s creativity._ Journal of Childhood, Education & Society, 5(2), 176–200.**
  - Why it matters: identifies factors at individual, family, school, and socio-cultural levels that influence creativity, useful for designing environments that surface student gifts.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.37291/2717638X.202452371

## 6) Broader pedagogical models with evidence: Montessori and IB

### Montessori (systematic review, Campbell Collaboration)
- **Randolph, J. J., et al. (2023). _Montessori education’s impact on academic and nonacademic outcomes: A systematic review._ Campbell Systematic Reviews, 19(3), e1330.**
  - Why it matters: synthesizes outcomes including executive function and creativity, useful as a “proven” child-centered baseline model to learn from.
  - Link: https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1330  
  - Campbell summary page: https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/review/montessori-impact-on-academic-and-nonacademic-outcomes/

### International Baccalaureate, critical thinking outcomes report
- **International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). (2025). _Critical thinking skills of DP students._**
  - Why it matters: program-level evidence and qualitative insights into how DP structures (like TOK and extended inquiry) may support critical thinking.
  - Link: https://www.ibo.org/research/outcomes-research/diploma-studies/critical-thinking-skills-of-dp-students/

## 7) High-signal “model in the wild” references for the 2-hour mastery + projects design

These are not academic papers, but they are useful for understanding current implementations and claims.

## Quick “what to read first” path (90 minutes)

1) Kestin et al. 2025 (AI tutor RCT)  
2) Létourneau et al. 2025 (K–12 ITS systematic review)  
3) Ha et al. 2025 (SEL meta-analysis)  
4) Albar & Southcott 2021 (PBL and creative behaviours)  
5) Ogut 2025 (Pomodoro review) or Wang et al. 2025 (flow and creativity), depending on your focus

## Notes for your startup research

If you want to map this into a research agenda, a strong next step is to define:

- What “deep flow” means operationally (time-on-task, distraction rate, affect, mastery velocity).
- What “spark” means (creativity measures, interest development, identity formation, self-efficacy).
- What outcomes you can measure quickly (weekly mastery velocity, retention, student wellbeing, collaboration quality).
