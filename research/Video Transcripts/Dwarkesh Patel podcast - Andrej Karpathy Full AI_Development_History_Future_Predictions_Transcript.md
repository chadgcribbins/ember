## Introduction

When personal learning is terrible, it just so happens that everything that we had before
is much worse.
I'm actually optimistic.
I think this will work.
I think it's tractable.
I'm only sounding pessimistic because when I go on my Twitter timeline, I see all the
stuff that makes no sense to me.
A lot of it is, I think, honestly, just fundraising.
We're not actually building animals.
We're building ghosts.
These lack sort of ethereal spirit entities because they're fully digital and they're
kind of like mimicking humans and it's a different kind of intelligence.
This business, as usual, because we're in an intelligence explosion already and have
been for decades.
Everything is gradually being automated, has been for hundreds of years.
Don't write blog posts, don't do slides, don't do any of that, like build a code, arrange
it, get it to work.
It's the only way to go, otherwise you're missing knowledge.
If you have a perfect AI tutor, maybe you can get extremely far.
The geniuses of today are bare-scratching the surface of what a human mind can do, I think.
Today, I'm speaking with Andre Karpathi.
Andre, why do you say that this will be the decade of agents and not the year of agents?
Well, first of all, thank you for having me here.
I'm excited to be here.
So the quote that you've just mentioned, it's the decade of agents.
That's actually a reaction to an existing pre-existing quote, I should say, where I think
a lot of some of the labs, I'm not actually sure who said this, but they were alluding
to this being the year of agents with respect to LLMs and how they were going to evolve.
And I think I was triggered by that because I feel like there's some over-predictions
going on in the industry and in my mind, this is really a lot more accurately described
as the decade of agents.
And we have some very early agents that are actually extremely impressive and that I use
daily, cloud and codex and so on, but I still feel like there's so much work to be done.
And so I think my reaction is, we'll be working with these things for a decade.
They're going to get better and it's going to be wonderful.
But I think I was just reacting to the timeline, I suppose, of the implication.
What do you think we'll take a decade to accomplish, where are the bottlenecks?
Well, actually make it work.
So in my mind, I mean, when you're talking about an agent, I guess, or what the labs
have in mind and what maybe I have in mind as well, is it's, you should think of it almost
like an employee or like an intern that you would hire to work with you.
So for example, you work with some employees here.
When would you prefer to have an agent like cloud or codex do that work?
Like, currently, of course, they can't.
What would it take for them to be able to do that?
Why don't you do it today?
And the reason you don't do it today is because they just don't work.
So like they don't have enough intelligence, they're not multimodal enough, they can
do computer use and all this kind of stuff.
They don't do a lot of the things that you've alluded to earlier.
You know, they don't have continued learning.
You can't just tell them something and they'll remember it.
Yeah.
And they're just cognitively lacking and it's just not working.
And I just think that it will take about a decade to work through all those issues.
Interesting.
So as a professional podcaster, a viewer of AI from afar, it's easy to identify for me.
Like, oh, here's what's lacking.
Continue learning is lacking or multimodality is lacking.
But I don't really have a good way of trying to put a timeline on it.
Like, if somebody's like, how long will continue learning take?
I, there's no like prior I have about like, this is a project that's like five years,
10 years, 50 years.
Why a decade?
Why not one year?
Why not 50 years?
Yeah, I guess this is where you get into like a bit of, I guess, my own intuition a little bit.
And also just kind of doing a bit of an extrapolation of with respect to my own experience in the field.
I guess I've been in AI for almost two decades.
I mean, it's going to be maybe 15 years or so, not that long.
You had Richard Sutton here who was all around, of course, for much longer.
But I do have about 15 years of experience of people making predictions of seeing how they actually turned out.
And also I was in the industry for a while and I was in research and I worked in the industry for a while.
So I guess I kind of have just a general intuition that I have left from that.
And I feel like the problems are tractable.
They're surmountable, but they're still difficult.
And if I just average it out, it just kind of feels like a ticket, I guess to me.
This is actually quite interesting.
## History of AI: Seismic Shifts

I want to like, you're not only the history, but what people in the room felt was about to happen at various different breakthrough moments.
Right.
What were the ways in which their feelings were either overly pessimistic or really optimistic?
Yeah, I mean, should we just go through each other one by one?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, that's a giant question because, of course, you're talking about 15 years of stuff that happened.
I mean, AI is actually like so wonderful because there have been a number of, I would say, seismic shifts.
That were like the entire feel has sort of like suddenly looked a different way, right?
And I guess I've maybe lived through two or three of those.
And I still think there will continue to be some because they come with some kind of like almost surprising irregularity.
Well, when my career began, of course, like when I started to work on deep learning, when I became interested in deep learning,
this was just kind of like, by chance of being right next to Jeff Hinton at the University of Toronto.
And Jeff Hinton, of course, is kind of like the Godfather figure of AI.
And he was training all these neural networks and I thought it was incredible and interesting.
But this was not like the main thing that everyone in the AI was doing by far.
This was a niche little subject on the side.
That's kind of maybe like the first like dramatic sort of seismic shift that came with the Alexander and so on.
I would say like Alex and it sort of recoring to everyone and everyone started to train neural networks.
But it was still like very like per task, per specific task.
So maybe I have an image classifier or I have a neural machine translator or something like that.
And people became very slowly actually interested in basically kind of agents, I would say.
And people started to think, okay, well, maybe we have a check mark next to the visual cortex or something like that.
But what about the other parts of the brain and how can we get an actual like full agent or in full entity that can actually interact in the world.
And I would say the Atari sort of deep reinforcement learning shift in 2013 or so was part of that early effort of agents in my mind.
Because it was an attempt to try to get agents that not just perceive the world, but also take actions and interact and get rewards from environments.
And at the time, this was Atari games.
And I kind of feel like that was a misstep actually and it was a misstep that actually even the early open AI that I was a part of, of course, kind of adopted because at that time, the site guys was reinforcement learning environments, games, game playing, beat games, get lots of different types of games and open I was doing a lot of that.
So that was maybe like another like prominent part of I would say AI where maybe for two or three or four years, everyone was doing reinforcement learning games.
And basically that was a little bit of a misstep and what I was trying to do at opening actually is like I was always a little bit suspicious of games as being like this thing that would actually lead to a GI because in my mind, you want something like an accountant or like something that's actually interacting with the real world.
And I just didn't see how games kind of like add up to it. And so my project at open AI, for example, was within the scope of the universe project.
And then on an agent that was using keyboard and mouse to operate a web pages. And I really wanted to have something that like interact with, you know, the actual digital world that can do knowledge work.
And it just so turns out that this was extremely early way too early. So early that the wishing had been working on that, you know, because
if you're just stumbling your way around and keyboard mashing and masking and trying to get rewards in these environments.
Your reward is two sparse and you just won't learn and you're going to burn a forest computing and you're never actually going to get something off the ground.
And so what you're missing is this power of representation in the neural network.
And so for example, today, people are training those computer using agents, but they're doing it on top of a large language model.
And so you actually have to get the language model first. You have to get the representations first and you do that by all the pre-training and all the LLM stuff.
So I kind of feel like maybe loosely speaking, it was like people keep maybe trying to get the full thing to early a few times where people like really try to go after agents too early.
I would say and that was Atari and universe and even my own experience. And you actually have to do some things first before you sort of get to those agents.
And maybe now the agents are a lot more competent, but maybe we're still missing sort of some parts of that stack.
But I would say maybe those are like the three like major buckets of what people were doing, training neural nets per tasks, trying to the first round of agents.
And then maybe the LLM's and actually seeking the representation power of the neural networks before you tack on everything else on top.
Interesting. Yeah, I guess if they were to steal man, the sort of a sudden perspective would be that humans actually can just take on everything at once.
Even animals can take on everything at once, right? Animals are maybe a better example because they don't even have the scaffold of language.
They just get thrown out into the world and they just have to make sense of everything without any labels.
## Building Animals vs. Building Ghosts

And the vision for AGI then should just be something which like just looks at sensory data looks like the computer screen and it just like figures out what's going on from scratch.
I mean, if a human was put in a similar situation that would be trained from scratch, but I mean, this is like a human growing up where animal growing up.
So why shouldn't that be the vision for AI rather than like this thing where we're doing millions of years of training?
I think that's a really good question. And I think, I mean, so something was in your podcast and I saw the podcast and I had to write up about that podcast almost that gets into a little bit of how I see things.
And I kind of feel like I'm very careful to make analogies to animals because they came about by very different optimization classes.
Animals are evolved and they actually come with a huge amount of hardware that's built in.
And when, for example, my example in the post was the zebra, a zebra gets born and a few minutes later is running around and following its mother.
That's an extremely complicated thing to do.
That's not reinforcement learning. That's something that's baked in an evolution, obviously, a some way of encoding the weights of our neural nets and ATCGs.
And I have no idea how that works, but it apparently works.
So I kind of feel like brains just were came from a very different process and I am very hesitant to take inspiration from it because we're not actually running that process.
So in my post, I kind of said, we're not actually building animals. We're building ghosts or spirits or whatever people want to call it because we're not.
We're not doing training by evolution. We're doing training by basically imitation of humans and the data that they've put on the internet.
And so you end up with these like sort of ethereal spirit entities because they're fully digital and they're kind of like mimicking humans and it's a different kind of intelligence.
Like if you imagine a space of intelligence is we were starting off at a different point almost we're not we're not really building animals.
But I think it's also possible to make them a bit more animal-like over time and I think we should be doing that.
And so I kind of feel like sort of just I guess one more point is I do feel like Sutton basically has a very like his framework is like we want to build animals.
And I actually think that would be wonderful. If we can get that to work, that would be amazing.
If there was a single like algorithm that you can just you know run on the internet and it learns everything that would be incredible.
I almost suspect that I'm not actually sure that it exists and that's certainly actually not what animals do.
Because animals have this outer loop of evolution.
Right.
And a lot of what looks like learning is actually a lot more maturation of the brain.
And I think that's actually actually very little reinforcement learning for animals.
And I think a lot of the reinforcement learning is actually like more like motor tasks. It's not intelligence tasks.
So actually kind of think humans don't actually like really us are all roughly speaking is what I would say.
Can you read the lessons? A lot of that intelligence is not motor tasks. It's right.
A lot of the reinforcement learning in my perspective would be things that are a lot more like motor like like simple kind of like task throwing hoop or stuff like that.
But I don't think that humans use reinforcement learning for a lot of intelligence tasks like problem solving and so on.
Interesting.
That doesn't mean we don't have we we shouldn't do that for research, but I just feel like that's what animals do or that.
I'm going to take a second to digest that because there's a lot of different ideas.
Maybe it was one clarification question I can ask to understand the perspective.
So I think you suggest that look evolution is doing the kind of thing that pre training does in the sense of building something which can then understand the world.
The difference I guess is that evolution has to be titrated in the case of humans through three gigabytes of DNA.
And so that's very unlike the weights of a model.
I mean, literally the weights of the model are a brain, which obviously is not encoded in the sperm and the egg or does not exist in the sperm and the egg.
So it has to be grown and also the information for every single synapse in the brain simply cannot exist in the three gigabytes that exist in the DNA.
Evolution seems closer to finding the algorithm, which then does the lifetime learning.
Now, maybe the lifetime learning is not analogous to RL to your point.
Is that compatible with the thing you were saying or would you disagree with that?
I think so. I would agree with you that there's some miraculous compression going on because obviously the weights of the neural net are not stored in the TCG.
There's some kind of a dramatic compression and there's some kind of like learning algorithms encoded that that take over and do some of the learning online.
So I definitely agree with you on that.
Basically, I would say I'm a lot more kind of like practically minded.
I don't come at it from a perspective of like let's build animals.
I come from a perspective of like let's build useful things.
So I have a hard hat on and I'm just observing that look, we're not going to do evolution because I don't know how to do that.
But it does turn out we can build these ghost spirit like entities by imitating internet documents.
This works and it's actually kind of like it's a way to bring you up to something that has a lot of sort of built in knowledge and intelligence in some way.
Similar to maybe what evolution has done.
So that's why I kind of call pre-training this kind of like crappy evolution.
It's like the practically possible version with art technology and what we have available to us to get to a starting point where we can actually do things like reinforcement learning and so on.
Just to steal man the other perspective because after doing this interview and thinking about it, it has an important point here.
Evolution does not give us the knowledge really right it gives us the algorithm to find the knowledge and that seems different from training.
So if perhaps the perspective is that pre-training helps build the kind of entity which can learn better it teaches meta learning.
And therefore it is a similar to like finding an algorithm.
But if it's like evolution gives us knowledge of pre-training gives us knowledge or they're not that analogy seems to break down.
So it's subtle and I think you're right to push back on it.
But basically the thing that pre-training is doing so you're basically getting the next token predictor on over the internet and you're training that into a neural net.
It's doing two things actually there are kind of like unrelated number one.
It's picking up all this knowledge as I call it number two.
It's actually becoming intelligent by observing the algorithmic patterns in the internet.
It actually kind of like boots up all these like little circuits and algorithms inside the neural net to do things like in context learning and all this kind of stuff.
And actually you don't actually need or want the knowledge.
I actually think that's probably actually holding back the neural networks overall because it's actually like getting them to rely on the knowledge all too much sometimes.
For example, I kind of feel like agents one thing they're not very good at is going off the data manifold of what exists on the internet.
If they had less knowledge or less memory, actually maybe they would be better.
And so what I think we have to do kind of going forward and this would be part of the research paradigms is actually think we need to start.
We need to figure out ways to remove some of the knowledge and to keep what I call this is this cognitive core is this like intelligent entity that is kind of strict from knowledge, but contains the algorithms and contains the magic, you know, of intelligence and problem solving and strategies of it and all this kind of stuff.
There's so much interesting stuff there.
## In-Context Learning and Pre-Training

Okay, so let's start with in context learning.
This is an obvious point, but I think it's worth just like saying it explicitly and meditating on it.
The situation in which these models seem the most intelligent in which they are like I talked to them and I'm like, wow, there's really something on the other end that's responding to me thinking about things.
If it like makes a mistake, it's like, oh, wait, that's actually the wrong way to think about it. I'm packing up.
All that is happening in context. That's why I feel like the real intelligence you can like visibly see.
And that in context learning process is developed by gradient descent on pre training, right?
Like it's spontaneously meta learns in context learning.
But the in context learning itself is not gradient descent in the same way that our lifetime intelligence as humans to be able to do things is conditioned by evolution.
But our actual learning during our lifetime is like happening through some other process.
I actually don't fully agree with that, but you should continue your thought.
Actually, then I'm curious to understand how that analogy breaks down.
I think I'm hesitant to say that in context learning is not doing gradient descent.
Because I mean, it's not doing explicit gradient descent, but I still think that.
So in context learning, basically, it's pattern completion within a token window, right?
And it just turns out that there's a bunch of patterns on the internet.
And so you write the model kind of like learns to complete the pattern.
And that's inside the weights.
The weights of the neural network are trying to discover patterns and complete the pattern.
And there's some kind of adaptation that happens inside the neural network, right?
Which is kind of magical and just falls out from internet just because there's a lot of patterns.
I will say that there have been some papers that I thought were interesting that actually look at the mechanisms behind in context learning.
And I do think it's possible that in context learning actually runs a small green descent loop internally in the layers of the neural network.
And so I recall one paper in particular where they were doing a linear regression actually using in context learning.
So basically your inputs into the neural network are x, y pairs, x, y, x, y that happened to be on the line.
And then you do x and you expect the y.
And the neural network when you train it in this way actually does do does do a linear regression.
And normally when you would run linear regression, you have a small green descent optimizer that basically looks at x, y, looks at an error, calculus, the gradient of the weights and does the update a few times.
It just turns out that when they looked at the weights of that in context learning algorithm,
they actually found some analogies to to gradient descent and mechanics.
In fact, I think even the paper once was stronger because they actually hard coded the weights of the neural network to do gradient descent through attention and all the internals of the neural network.
So I guess that's just my only pushback is that who knows how in context learning works, but I actually think that it's probably doing a little bit of some kind of funky gradient descent internally.
And then I think that that's that's possible.
So I guess I was only pushing back on you're saying it's not doing in context learning who knows what it's doing, but it's probably maybe doing something similar to it, but we don't know.
So then it's worth thinking about, OK, if both of them are implementing gradient is start if in context learning and pre training are both implementing something like gradient descent.
Why does it feel like in context learning actually we're getting to this like continual learning real intelligence like thing.
Whereas you don't get the analogous feeling just from pre training, at least you could argue that.
And so if it's the same algorithm, what could be different? Well, one way you can think about it is how much information does the model store per
information that receives from training.
And if you look at pre training, if I think if you look at llama three, for example, I think it's trained on 15 trillion tokens and if you look at a 70 B model, that would be the equivalent of 0.07 bits per token in that it sees in pre training.
In terms of like the information in the weights of the model compared to the tokens that reads.
Whereas if you look at the KV cache and how it grows per additional token in context learning, it's like 320 kilobytes.
Yeah, so that's a 35 million full difference in how much information per token is assimilated by the model.
I wonder if that's relevant at all.
I think I kind of agree. I mean, the way I usually put this is that anything that happens during the training of the neural network.
The knowledge is only kind of like a hazy recollection of what happened in train in the training time.
And that's because the compression is dramatic. You're taking 15 trillion tokens and you're compressing it to just your final network of a few billion parameters.
So obviously it's a massive amount of compression going on.
So I kind of refer to it as like a hazy recollection of the internet documents.
Whereas anything that happens in the context window of the neural network, you're plugging all the tokens and building up all this KV cache representation is very directly accessible to the neural net.
So I compare the KV cache and the stuff that happens at test time to like more like a working memory.
Like all the stuff that's in the in the in the context window is very directly accessible to the neural net.
So there's always like these
almost surprising analogies between LLMS and humans.
And I find them kind of surprising because we're not trying to build a human brain, of course.
Just directly we're just finding that this works and we're doing it.
But I do think that
anything that's in the weights, it's kind of like a hazy recollection of what you read a year ago.
Anything that you give it as a context at test time is directly in the working memory.
And I think that's a very powerful analogy to things for things.
So when you, for example, go to an LLM and you ask it about some book and what happened in it, like on the claims book or something like that.
The LLM will often give you some stuff, which is roughly correct.
But if you give it the full chapter and ask it questions, you're going to get much better results because it's now loaded in the working memory of the model.
So I basically agree with you are very long way of saying that I kind of agree and that's why it's stepping back.
What is the part about human intelligence that we like have a most feel to replicate with these models?
I almost feel like just just a lot of it.
So maybe one way to think about it. I don't know if this is the best way.
But I almost kind of feel like again, making these analogies in perfect as they are.
We've stumbled by with the transformer neural network, which is extremely powerful.
Very general. You can train transformers on audio or video or text or whatever you want.
And it just learns patterns and they're very powerful and it works really well.
That to me almost indicates that this is kind of like some piece of cortical tissue.
It's something like that because the cortex is famously very plastic as well.
You can rewire, you know, parts of brains.
And there was a slightly gruesome experiments with rewiring like visual cortex, the auditory cortex and this animal like learn file, et cetera.
So I think that this is kind of like a cortical tissue.
I think when we're doing reasoning and planning inside the neural networks, so basically doing a reasoning traces for thinking models, that's kind of like the prefrontal cortex.
And then I think we maybe those are like little check marks.
But I still think there's many brain parts and nuclei that are not explored.
So maybe for example, there's a basal ganglia doing a bit of reinforcement learning when we find two in the models on reinforcement learning.
But, you know, whereas like the hippocampus, not obvious what that would be.
Some parts are probably not important. Maybe the cerebellum is like not important to cognition.
It's thoughts of maybe we can skip some of it.
But I still think there's, for example, the amygdala, all the emotions and instincts.
And there's probably like a bunch of other nuclei in the brain that are very ancient that I don't think we've like really replicated.
I don't actually know that we should be pursuing, you know, the building of an analog of human brain.
Again, an engineer, mostly at heart. But I still feel like maybe another way to answer the question is,
you're not going to hire this thing as an intern and it's missing a lot of it's because it comes with a lot of these cognitive deficits that we all intuitively feel when we talk to the models.
And so it's just like not fully there yet.
You can look at it as like not all the brain parts are checked off yet.
This is maybe relevant to the question of thinking about how fast these issues will be solved.
So sometimes people will say about continual learning. Look, actually you could already you could easily replicate this capability just as in context learning emerged spontaneously as a result of pre-training.
Continual learning over longer horizons will emerge spontaneously if the model is incentivized to recollect information over longer horizons or horizons longer than one session.
So if there's some like outer loop RL, which has many sessions within that outer loop, then like this continual learning where it uses like fine tunes itself or it writes to an external memory or something will just sort of like emerged spontaneously.
Do you think? Do you think things are in there that are plausible? I just I don't have really a prior of it. How plausible is that? How likely is that to happen?
I don't know that I fully resonate with that because I feel like these models when you boot them up and they have zero tokens in the window, they're always like restarting from scratch where they were.
So I don't actually know in that world view what it looks like because again, maybe making some analogies to humans just because I think it's roughly concrete and kind of interesting to think through.
I feel like when I'm awake, I'm building up a context window of stuff that's happening during the day, but I feel like when I go to sleep, something magical happens where I don't actually think that that context window stays around.
I think there's some process of distillation into weights of my brain and this happens during sleep and all this kind of stuff.
We don't have an equivalent of that in large language models and that's to me more adjacent to when you talk about continual learning and so on as absent.
These models don't really have a distillation phase of taking what happened, analyzing it, obsessively thinking through it, basically doing some kind of a synthetic data generation process and distilling it back into the weights and maybe having, you know, specific neural net per person.
Maybe it's a Laura. It's not a full, yeah, it's not a full weight neural network. That's just small, some of the small sparse subset of the weights are changed.
But basically, we do want to create a ways of creating these individuals that have very long contexts. It's not only remaining in a context window because the context windows grow very, very long.
Like maybe we have some very elaborate sparse attention over it, but I still think that humans obviously have some process for distilling some of that knowledge into the weights. We're missing it.
And I do also think that humans have some kind of a very elaborate sparse attention scheme, which I think we're starting to see some early hints of.
So deep seek V 3.2 just came out and I saw that they have like a sparse attention as an example. And this is one way to have very, very long context windows.
So I almost feel like we are redoing a lot of the cognitive tricks that evolution came up with through a very different process.
But we're I think converged on a similar architecture cognitively interesting.
In 10 years, do you think it will still be something like a transformer, but with a much more modified attention and more sparse MLPs and so forth.
Well, the way I like to think about it is, okay, let's translation invariants in time, right? So 10 years ago, where were we 2015?
We had a convolutional neural networks primarily residual networks just came out.
So remarkably similar, I guess, but quite a bit different still. I mean, transformer was not around.
You know, all the all these sort of like more modern tweaks on a transformer were not around.
So maybe some of the things that we can bet on, I think in 10 years by translational sort of equival variance.
Is we're still training general networks with forward backward pass and update through gradient descent.
But maybe it looks a little bit different and it's just everything is much bigger.
Actually, recently, I also went back all the way to 1989, which was kind of a fun exercise for me a few years ago.
Because I was reproducing Jan LaCoon's 1989 convolutional network, which was the first neural network.
I'm aware of trained via gradient descent, like modern neural network trained gradient descent on digital recognition.
And I was just interested in, okay, how can I modernize this? How much of this is algorithms?
How much of this is data? How much of this progress is compute and systems?
And I was able to very quickly like half the learning rate just knowing by time travel by 33 years.
So if I time travel by algorithms to 33 years, I could adjust with Jan LaCoon data in 1989 and I could basically have the learning half the air.
But to get further gains, I had to add a lot more data. I had to like 10X the training set.
And then I had to actually add more computational optimizations.
I had to basically train for much longer, would drop out and other regularization techniques.
And so it's almost like all these things have to improve simultaneously.
So, you know, we're probably going to have a lot more data.
We're probably going to have a lot better hardware, probably going to have a lot better kernels and software.
We're probably going to have better algorithms. And all of those, it's almost like no one of them is winning too much.
All of them are surprisingly equal.
And this has kind of been the trend for a while.
I guess to answer maybe your question, I expect differences for the algorithmically to what's happening today.
But I do also expect that some of the things that have stuck around for a very long time will probably still be there.
It's probably still a giant neural network trained with gradient descent. That would be my guess.
It's surprising that all of those things together only have the error.
Which is like 30 years of progress is maybe maybe half is a lot because like if you have the error, that actually means that half is a lot.
But I guess what we're shocking to me is everything needs to improve across the board architecture, optimize a loss function and also has improved across the board forever.
So I kind of expect all those changes to be alive and well.
## NanoChat and Learning by Building

Yeah, I was about to ask you a very similar question about NanoChat.
Because since you just coded up recently, every single sort of step in the process of building a chatbot is like fresh in your RAM.
And I'm curious if you had similar thoughts about like, oh, there was no one thing that was relevant to going from GPT2 to NanoChat.
What are sort of like surprising takeaways from the experience of building a chat?
So NanoChat is a kind of repository I released was it yesterday or a day before I can't remember.
We can see this leave the variation though and into the well, it's just trying to be a.
It's trying to be the simplest, complete repository that covers the whole pipeline into end of building a chat GPT clone.
And so, you know, you have all of the steps, not just any individual step, which is a bunch.
I worked on all the individual steps sort of in the past and really small pieces of code that could have show you how that's done in algorithmic sense.
In like simple code, but this kind of handles all the entire pipeline.
I think in terms of learning, it's not it's not so much.
I don't know that I actually found something that I learned from from it necessarily.
I kind of already had in my mind as like how you build it.
And this is just a process of mechanically building it and making it clean enough.
And so that people can actually learn from it and that they find it useful.
Yeah, what is the best way for somebody to learn from it?
Is it just like delete all the code and try to re-implement from scratch, try to add modifications to it?
Yeah, I think that's a great question.
I would probably say, so basically it's about a thousand lines of code that takes you through the entire pipeline.
I would probably put it on the right monitor, like if you have two monitors, you put it on the right.
And you want to build it from scratch, you build it from start, you're not allowed to copy paste.
You're allowed to reference, you're not allowed to copy paste.
Maybe that's how I would do it.
But I also think the repository by itself, it is like a pretty large beast.
I mean, it's, you know, it's a ritz.
When you write this code that you don't go from top to bottom, you go from chunks and you grow the chunks.
And that information is absent, like you wouldn't know where to start.
And so I think it's not just a final repository that's needed.
It's like the building of the repository, which is a complicated chunk growing process.
Right.
So that part is not there yet.
I would love to actually like add that probably later this week or something in some way.
Like either it's a, it's probably a video or something like that.
But, but maybe roughly speaking, that's what I would try to do is build the stuff yourself.
But don't allow yourself copy paste.
I do think that there's two types of knowledge, almost like there's the high level surface knowledge.
But the thing is that when you actually build something from scratch,
you're forced to come to terms with what you don't actually understand and you don't know that you don't understand it.
Interesting.
And it always leads to a deeper understanding.
And it's like just the only way to build is like, if I can't build it, I don't understand it.
Is that a finite code, I believe, or something along those lines?
I 100% I've always believed this very strongly.
Because there's all these like micro things that are just not properly arranged.
And you don't really have the knowledge, you just think you have the knowledge.
So don't write blockposts, don't do slides, don't do any of that.
Like build the code, arrange it, get it to work.
So the only way to go, otherwise you're missing knowledge.
## AI-Assisted Coding and Its Limitations

You treated out that coding models were actually a very little help to you in assembling this repository.
And I'm curious why that was.
Yeah.
So the repository, I guess I built it over a period of a bit more than a month.
And I would say there's like three major classes of how people interact with code right now.
Some people completely reject all of LLMS and they are just writing by scratch.
I think this is probably not there, there are things to do anymore.
The intermediate part, which is where I am, is you still write a lot of things from scratch,
but you use the autocomplete that's basically available now from these models.
So when you start writing out, it will be piece of it.
It will, they were all complete for you and you can just tap through and most of the time it's correct.
Sometimes it's not and you edit it.
But you're still very much the sort of architect of what you're writing.
And then there's the vibe coding, you know,
how I please implement this or that, you know, enter and then let the model do it.
And that's the agents.
I do feel like the agents work in very specific settings.
And I would use them as specific settings.
But again, these are all tools available to you and you have to like learn what they,
what they're good at and what you're not good at and what to use them.
So the agents are actually pretty good, for example, if you're doing boilerplate stuff,
boilerplate code that's like just copy, you know, just copy-based stuff.
They're very good at that.
They're very good at stuff that occurs very often in the internet.
Because there's lots of examples of it in the training sets of these models.
So, so there's like features of things that where the models will do very well.
I would say nanochet is not an example of this because it's a fairly unique repository.
There's not that much code, I think, in a way that I've structured it and and it's not boilerplate code.
It's like actually like intellectual intense code almost and everything has to be very precisely arranged.
And the models we're always trying to, they kept trying to, I mean, they have so many cognitive deficits, right?
So one example, they keep trying to, they keep misunderstanding the code because they,
they have too much memory from all the typical ways of doing things on the internet that I just wasn't adopting.
So the models, for example, I mean, I don't know if I want to get into the full details,
but they keep, they keep, they keep thinking I'm writing normal code and I'm not.
Maybe one example.
So the way to synchronize, so we have eight GPUs that are all doing forward efforts.
The way to synchronize gradients between them is to use distributed data parallel container of PyTorch,
which automatically does all the, as you're doing the back where it will start communicating and synchronizing gradients.
I didn't use DDP because I didn't want to use it because it's not necessary.
So I threw it out and I basically wrote my own synchronization routine that's inside the step of the optimizer.
And so the models were trying to get me to use the DDP container.
Yeah. And they were very concerned about, okay, this gets way too technical.
But I wasn't using that container because I don't need it and I have a custom implementation of something like it.
And they just couldn't internalize it. You had your own.
Yeah, they couldn't, they couldn't get passed out.
And then they kept trying to like mess up the style like they're way too over defensive.
They have made all these tri-catch statements.
They keep trying to make a production code base.
And I have a bunch of assumptions in my code and it's okay.
And, and it's just like, I don't need all this extra stuff in there.
And so I just kind of feel like they're bloating the code base, they're bloating the complexity, they keep misunderstanding.
They're using deprecated APIs a bunch of times.
So it's total mess.
And it's just, it's just not net useful. I can go in and I can clean it up, but it's not net useful.
I also feel like it's kind of annoying to have to like type out what I want in English because it's just too much typing.
Like, if I just navigate to the part of the code that I want and I go where I know the code has to appear
and I start typing out the first three letters, autocomplete gets it and just gets it the code.
And so I think it's, this is a very high information bandwidth to specify what you want.
If you point to the code where you want it and you type out the first few pieces and the model will complete it.
So I guess what I mean is, I think these models are good in certain parts of the stack.
I actually use the models a little bit in, there are two examples where I actually use the models that I think are illustrative.
One was when I generated a report and that's actually more boilerplatey.
So I actually bycoded partially some of that stuff. That was fine.
Because it's not like mission critical stuff and it works fine.
And then the other part is when I was rewriting the tokenizer in Rust.
I'm actually not as good at Rust because I'm fairly new to Rust.
So I was doing, there's a bit of vibe coding going on in when I was writing some of the Rust code.
But I had Python implementation that I fully understand and I'm just making sure I'm making more efficient version of it and I have tests.
So I feel safer doing that stuff.
And so basically they lower or like the increase accessibility to languages or paradigms that you might not be as familiar with.
So I think they're very helpful there as well.
Yeah, because there's a ton of Rust code out there that models are actually pretty good at it.
I happen to know that much about it. So the models are very useful there.
The reason I think this question is so interesting is because the main story people have about AI exploding and getting super intelligence pretty rapidly
is AI automating AI engineering and AI research.
So they'll look at the fact that you can have cloud code and make entire application, crowd application, subscribe and be like.
If you had this capability inside of open AI and deep mind and everything, well, just imagine the level of like just, you know,
a thousand of you or a million of you in parallel finding little architectural tweaks.
And so it's quite interesting to hear you say that this is the thing they're sort of asymmetrically worse at.
And it's like quite relevant to forecasting whether the AI 2027 type explosion is likely to happen anytime soon.
I think that's a good way of putting it.
And I think you're getting at some of my like why my timelines are a bit longer.
You're right.
I think, yeah, they're not very good at code that hasn't never been written before.
Maybe it's like one way to put it, which is like what we're trying to achieve when we're building these models.
Very naive question, but the architectural tweaks that you're adding to nano chat.
They're in a paper somewhere, right? They might even be in a repo somewhere.
So is it, is it surprising that they aren't able to integrate that into whenever you're like,
add rope embeddings or something, they do that in the wrong way?
It's, it's tough. I think they kind of know, they kind of know, but they don't fully know.
And they don't know how to fully integrate it into the repo and your style and your code and your place and some of the custom things that you're doing.
And how fits with all the assumptions of the repository and all this kind of stuff.
So I think they do have some knowledge, but they haven't gotten to the place where they can actually integrate it, make sense of it, and so on.
I do think that a lot of the stuff, by the way, continues to improve.
So I think currently probably state of the art model that I go to is the GPT-5 Pro.
And that's a very, very powerful model.
So if I actually have 20 minutes, I will copy paste my entire repo and I go to GPT-5 Pro, the Oracle for like some questions.
And often it's not too bad and surprisingly good compared to what existed a year ago.
But I do think that overall the models are, they're not there.
And I kind of feel like the industry, it's over, it's making too big of a jump.
And it's trying to pretend like this is amazing and it's not, it's slop.
And I think they're not coming to terms with it and maybe they're trying to fundraise or something like that.
I'm not sure what's going on, but we're at this intermediate stage.
The models are amazing. They still leave a lot of work for now, out of complete is my sweet spot.
But sometimes for some times of code, I will go to a null and agent.
Yeah.
Actually, this is also, here's another reason why this is really interesting.
Through the history of programming, there's been many productivity improvements,
compilers, linting, better programming languages, et cetera, which have increased for a program of productivity,
but have not led to an explosion.
So that's like one, that sounds very much like an autocomplete tab.
And this other category is just like automation of the programmer.
And it's interesting.
You're seeing more in the category of the historical analogies of like, you know,
better compilers or something.
I mean, because this gets at one other kind of thought about is like,
I do feel like I have a hard time differentiating where AI begins and stops.
Because I do see AI as fundamentally an extension of computing in some, in some pretty fundamental way.
And I feel like I see a continuum of this kind of like recursive self improvement,
or like of speeding up programmers all the way from the beginning.
Like, even like, I would say like code editors, syntax highlighting,
yeah, syntax or like checking even of the types, like data type checking.
All these kinds of tools that we've built for each, for each other, even search engines,
like why aren't search engines part of AI?
Like, I don't know, like ranking is kind of AI, right?
At some point, Google was like, even early on, they were thinking of themselves as an AI company
doing Google search engine, which I think is totally fair.
And so I kind of see it as a lot more of a continuum than I think other people do.
And I don't, it's hard for me to draw the line.
And I kind of feel like, okay, we're now getting a much better autocomplete.
And now we're also getting some agents, which are kind of like these loopy things,
but they kind of go off rails sometimes.
And what's going on is that the human is progressively doing a bit less and less of the low level stuff.
For example, we're not writing the assembly code because we have compilers, right?
Compilers will take my high level language and see and write the assembly code.
So we're abstracting ourselves very, very slowly.
And there's this what I call autonomy slider of like more and more stuff is automated
of the stuff that can be automated at any point in time.
And we're doing a bit less and less than raising ourselves in the late abstraction over the automation.
One of the big problems with RL is that it's incredibly information sparse.
The toolbox can help you with this by increasing the amount of information
that your agent gets to learn from with every single episode.
For example, one of their customers wanted to train a coding agent.
So label box augmented an IDE with a bunch of extra data collection tools
and staffed a team of expert software engineers from their aligner network
to generate trajectories that were optimized for training.
Now, obviously, these engineers evaluated these interactions on a pass field basis.
But they also rated every single response on a bunch of different dimensions
like readability and performance and they wrote down their thought processes
for every single rating that they gave.
So you're basically showing every single step an engineer takes
and every single thought that they have while they're doing their job.
And this is just something you could never get from usage data alone.
And so label box packaged up all these evaluations and included
all the agent trajectories and the correct of human edits for the customer to train on.
This is just one example.
So go check out how label box can get you high quality frontier data
across domains, modalities, and training paradigms.

## Reinforcement Learning: Problems and Potential

Let's talk about RL a bit.
You two do some very interesting things about this.
Conceptually, how should we think about the way that humans are able to build
a rich world model just from interacting with our environment
and in ways that seems almost irrespective of the final reward at the end of the episode.
If somebody, you know, somebody starting a charter business
and at the end of 10 years, she finds out whether the business succeeded or failed.
We say that she's earned a bunch of wisdom and experience.
But it's not because like the log probes of every single thing that happened
over the last 10 years are up weighted or down weighted, something much more deliberate
and rich is happening.
What is the ML analogy?
And how does that compare to what we're doing with other ones right now?
Yeah, maybe the way I would put it is humans don't use reinforcement learning
is maybe what I've said at all.
I think they do something different, which is, yeah, you experience.
So reinforcement learning is a lot worse than I think the average person thinks.
reinforcement learning is terrible.
It just so happens that everything that we had before it is much worse.
Because previously we're just imitating people.
So it has all these issues.
So in reinforcement learning, say working with you're solving a math problem.
This is very simple. You're given a math problem and you're trying to find the solution.
Now in reinforcement learning, you will try it lots of things in parallel first.
So you're given a problem.
You try hundreds of different attempts and these attempts can be complex, right?
They can be like, oh, let me try this.
Let me try that. This didn't work. That didn't work, et cetera.
And then maybe you get an answer.
And I checked the back of the book and you see, okay, the correct answer is this.
And then you can see that, okay, this one, this one and that one got the correct answer.
But these other 97 of them didn't.
So literally what reinforcement learning does is it goes to the ones that worked really well.
And every single thing you did along the way, every single token gets up weighted of like do more of this.
The problem with that is I mean, people will say that your estimator has high variance.
But what I mean, just noisy, it's noisy.
So basically, it kind of almost assumes that every single little piece of the solution that you made,
that write the dry answer was correct thing to do, which is not true.
Like you may have gone down the wrong alleys until you write the right solution.
Every single one of those incorrect things you did, as long as you got to the correct solution,
will be up weighted as do more of this. It's terrible.
Yeah, it's noise.
You've done all this work only to find a single, at the end, you get a single number of like,
oh, you did correct.
And based on that, you weigh that entire trajectory is like up weight or down weight.
And so you're the way I like to put it is you're sucking supervision through straw
because you've done all this work that could be a minute of roll out.
And you're like sucking the bits of supervision of the final reward signal through straw.
And you're like putting it, you're like, you're basically like,
yeah, you're broadcasting that across the entire trajectory and using that to up weight or down with that trajectory.
It's too crazy.
A human would never do this. Number one, a human would never do hundreds of roll outs.
Number two, when a person sort of finds a solution, they will have a pretty complicated process of review
of like, okay, I think these parts that I did well, these parts I did not do that well.
I should probably do this or that and they think through things.
There's nothing in current LLM that does this.
There's no equivalent of it.
But I do see papers popping out that are trying to do this because it's obvious to everyone in the field.
So I kind of see as like the first imitation learning actually, by the way,
was extremely surprising and miraculous and amazing that we can fine tune by imitation of humans.
And that was incredible because in the beginning, all we had was base models.
Base models are autocomplete.
And it wasn't obvious to me at the time and I had to learn this and the paper that like blew my mind was instruct GPT
because it pointed out that, hey, you can trade the pre-train model, which is autocomplete.
And if you just fine tune it on text that looks like conversations,
the model will very rapidly adapt to become a very conversational and it keeps all the knowledge from pre-train.
And this blew my mind because I didn't understand that it's just like stylistically can adjust so quickly
and become an assistant to a user through just a few loops of fine tuning on that kind of data.
It was very miraculous to me that that worked.
So incredible.
And that was like two years, three years of work.
And now came RL.
And RL allows you to do a bit better than just imitation learning, right?
Because you can't have these reward functions and you can hill climb on the reward functions.
And so some problems have just correct answers.
You can hill climb on that without getting expert trajectories to imitate.
So that's amazing.
And the model can also discover solutions that the human mind never come up with.
So this is incredible.
And yet, it's still stupid.
So I think we need more.
And so I saw a paper from Google yesterday that tried to have this reflect and review-paid idea in mind.
What was the memory bank paper or something? I don't know.
I've actually seen a few papers along these lines.
So I expect there to be some kind of a major update to how we do algorithms
for algorithms coming in that realm.
And then I think we need three or four or five more.
Something like that.
But you're so clear to come up with the evocative evocative phrases.
Sucking supervision through a straw is like so good.
Why hasn't, so you're saying like you're problem with outcome based reward is that you have this huge
trajectory. And then at the end, you're trying to learn every single possible thing about what you should do
in which you should learn about the world from that one final bit.
Why hasn't given the fact that this is obvious?
Why hasn't process-based supervision as an alternative,
been a success way to make models more capable?
What has been preventing us from using this alternative paradigm?
So process-based supervision just refers to the fact that we're not going to have a reward function only at the very end.
After you've made 10 minutes of work, I'm not going to tell you you did well or not.
I'm going to tell you at every single step of the way how well you're doing.
And this is basically the reason we don't have that is not tricky, how you do that properly.
Because you have partial solutions and you don't know how to assign credit.
So when you get the right answer, it's just an equality match to the answer, very simple to implement.
If you're doing basically process supervision, how do you assign an automatable way, partial credit assignment?
It's not obvious how you do it.
Lots of labs, I think, are trying to do it with these LLM judges.
So basically you get LLMs to try to do it.
So you prompt an LLM, hey, look at a partial solution of a student.
How well do you think they're doing if the answer is this and they try to tune the prompt?
The reason that I think this is kind of tricky is quite subtle.
And it's the fact that anytime you use an LLM to assign a reward, those LLMs are giant things with billions of parameters and they're gameable.
And if you're reinforcement learning with respect to them, you will find adversarial examples for your LLM judges, almost guaranteed.
You can't do this for too long, you do maybe 10 steps or 20 steps, maybe it will work.
But you can't do 100 or 1000 because it's not obvious because I know I understand it's not obvious, but basically the model will find
little cracks.
It will find all these like spurious things in the nooks and crannies of the giant model and find a way to cheat it.
So one example that's prominently in my mind is I think this, I think this was probably public.
But basically if you're using an LLM judge for a reward, so you just give it a solution from a student and ask it if the student will or not.
We were training with reinforcement learning against that reward function and it worked really well.
And then suddenly the reward became extremely large, like it was massive jump and it did perfect.
And you're looking at it like, wow, this, this means the student is perfect and all these problems is fully solved math.
But actually what's happening is that when you look at the completions that you're getting from the model, they are complete nonsense.
They start out, okay, and then they change to the, the, the, the, the.
So it's just like, oh, okay, let's take two plus three and we do this and this and then the, the, the, the, the.
And you're looking at it is like this is crazy.
How is it getting a reward of one or 100% and you look at the LLM judge and turns out
that the, the, the, the, the is an adversarial examples for the model and it assigns 100% probability to it.
And it's just because this is an out of sample example to the LLM.
It's never seen you during training and you're in pure generalization land.
It's never seen you during training and in the pure generalization land, you can find these examples that, that break it.
You're basically training the LLM to be a prompt injection model.
Not even that prompt injection is way too fancy.
You're, you're finding adversarial examples that are called it.
These are nonsensical solutions that are obviously wrong, but the model things are amazing.
So to this thing, you think this is the bottleneck to making RL more functional.
Then that will require making LLM's better judges if you want to do this in an automated way.
And then so is it just going to be like some sort of GAN like approach or you had to train models to be more robust?
Yeah.
I think the labs are probably doing all that like, okay, so the obvious thing is like the, the, the should not get a 100% reward.
Okay, well, take the, the, the, the, the training set of the LLM judge and say, this is not 100%.
This is 0%. You can do this.
But every time you do this, you get a new LLM and it still has adversarial examples.
There's infinity adversarial examples.
And I think probably if you iterate this a few times, it'll probably be hard and hard to find adversarial examples.
But I'm not 100% sure because this thing has a trillion parameters or whatnot.
So I bet you the, the labs are trying.
I don't actually, I still think, I still think we need other ideas.
Interesting. Do you do you have some shape of what the other idea?
So like this, this idea of like every review.
Yeah.
Review solution and compass synthetic examples, such that when you train on them, you get, you get better.
And like metallurne it in some way.
And I think there's some papers that I'm starting to see pop out.
I only am at a stage of like reading abstracts because a lot of these papers, you know, there's just ideas.
Someone has to actually like make it work on a frontier LLM lab scale in full generality.
Because when you see these papers, they pop up and it's just like a little bit of noisy, you know, it's cool ideas.
But I haven't actually seen anyone convincingly show that this is possible.
That said, the LLM labs are fairly closed.
Also, who knows what they're doing that, but yeah.
## Model Collapse, Synthetic Data and Reflection

So I guess I, I see a very not easy, but like I can conceptualize how you would be able to train on synthetic examples
or synthetic problems that you have made for yourself.
But there seems to be another thing humans do, maybe sleep is this, maybe day dreaming is this.
Which is not necessarily come up with fake problems, but just like reflect.
And I'm not sure what the MLA analogy for day dreaming or sleeping, but just reflecting.
I haven't come up with any problem.
I mean, obviously the very basic analogy just be like fine tuning on reflection bits.
But I feel like in practice, that probably wouldn't work that well.
So I don't know if you have some take on what, what the analogy of like this thing is.
Yeah, I do think that we're missing some aspects there.
So as an example, when you're reading a book.
I almost feel like currently when LLM's are reading a book, what that means is we stretch out the sequence of text.
And the model is predicting the next token and it's getting some knowledge from that.
That's not really what humans do, right?
So when you're reading a book, I almost don't even feel like the book is like exposition.
I'm supposed to be attending to and training on.
The book is a set of prompts for me to do synthetic data generation.
Or for you to get into a book club and talk about it with your friends.
And by manipulating that information that you actually gained that knowledge.
And I think we have no equivalent of that again with LLM's.
They don't really do that, but I'd love to see during pre-training some kind of a stage that thinks through the material and tries to reconcile with what it already knows.
And thinks through for like some amount of time and guess that to work.
And so there's no equivalence of any of this. This is all research.
There's some subtle, very subtle that I think are very hard to understand reasons why it's not trivial.
So if I can just, one, why can we just synthetically generate and train on it?
Well, because every synthetic example, like if I just give synthetic generation to the model thinking about a book.
You look at it and you like this looks great.
Why can't I train on it?
Well, you could try, but the model will actually get much worse if you continue trying.
And that's because all of the samples you get from models are silently collapsed.
They're silently.
This is not obvious if you look at any individual example of it.
They occupy a very tiny manifold of the possible space of sort of thoughts about content.
So the LLM's when they come off, they're what we call collapsed.
They have a collapse data distribution.
If you sample one easy way to see it is go to chat.
And ask it tell me a joke.
It only has like three jokes.
It's not giving you the whole breath of possible jokes.
It's giving you like it knows like three jokes.
They're silently collapsed.
So basically you're not getting the richness and diversity and the entropy
from these models as you would get from humans.
So humans are a lot more sort of noisier, but at least they're not biased.
They're not in a statistical sense.
They're not silently collapsed.
They maintain a huge amount of entropy.
So how do you get synthetic generation to work despite the collapse?
And while maintaining the entropy is a research problem.
Just to make sure I understood the reason that the collapse is relevant to synthetic
data generation is because you want to be able to come up with synthetic problems
or reflections, which are not already in your data distribution.
I guess what I'm saying is say we have a chapter of a book and I ask a no
to think about it.
It will give you something that looks very reasonable.
But if I ask it ten times, you'll notice that all of them are the same.
You can't just leave scaling, scaling, quote, unquote, reflection on the
same amount of, you know, prompt information and then get returns from that.
So any individual sample will look okay, but the distribution of it is quite terrible.
And it's quite terrible in such a way that if you continue training on
too much of your own stuff, you actually collapse.
I actually think that there's no like fundamental solutions to this possibly.
And I also think humans collapse over time.
I think this is again, these analogies are surprisingly good.
But humans collapse during the course of their lives.
This is why children have completely, you know, they haven't overfit yet.
And they will say stuff that will shock you because it's kind of,
you can see where they're coming from, but it's just not the thing people say.
And because they're not yet collapsed.
But we're collapsed.
We end up revisiting the same thoughts.
We end up, you know, saying more and more of the same stuff.
And the learning rates go down and the collapse continues to get worse.
And then everything deteriorates.
Have you seen this amazing paper or that dreaming is a way of preventing
this kind of overfitting in collapse that the reason the dreaming is a evolutionary
adaptive is to put you in weird situations that are like very unlike your day
to day reality so that to prevent this kind of overfitting.
That's an interesting idea.
I mean, I do think that when you're generating things in your head and then
you're attending to it, you're kind of like training on your own samples,
you're training on your synthetic data.
And if you do it for too long, you go off rails and you collapse way too much.
So you always have to like seek entropy in your life.
So talking to other people is a great source of entropy and things like that.
So maybe the brain has also built some internal mechanisms for increasing the
amount of entropy in that process.
But yeah, maybe that's an interesting idea.
This is a very ill-formed thought.
So I'll just put it out and let you react to it.
The best learners that we are aware of, which are children,
are extremely bad at recollecting information.
In fact, at the very earliest stages of childhood, you will forget everything.
You're just an amnesia about everything that happens before a certain year date.
But you're like extremely good at picking up new languages and learning from the world.
And maybe there's some element of like being able to see the forest for the trees.
Whereas if you compare it to the opposite of the spectrum, you have LLM
pre-training, which these models will literally would regurgitate word for word.
What is the next thing?
You know, we get PDF page.
But their ability to learn abstract concepts really quickly in the way a child can
is much more limited.
And then adults are somewhere in between where they don't have the flexibility
of childhood learning.
But adults can memorize facts and information in a way that is harder for kids.
And I don't know if there's something interesting about that.
I think there's something very interesting.
I do think that humans actually, they do kind of like have a lot more of an element
compared to LLM's of like seeing the forest for the trees.
And we're not actually that good at memorization, which is actually a feature.
Because we're not that good at memorization,
we actually are kind of like forced to find the patterns, like in a more general sense.
I think LLM's in comparison are extremely good at memorization.
They will recite passages from all these training sources.
You can give them completely nonsensical data.
You can hash some amount of text or something like that.
You get a completely random sequence.
If you train on it, even just I think a single iteration or two,
it can suddenly regurgitate the entire thing.
You'll memorize it.
There's no way a person can read a single sequence of random numbers and recite it to you.
And that's a feature, not a bug almost, because it forces you to like only learn the generalizable components.
Whereas LLM's are distracted by all the memory that they have of the preaching documents.
And it's probably very distracting to them in a certain sense.
So that's why when I talk about the cognitive core, I actually want to remove the memory,
which is what we talked about.
I'd love to have them have less memory so that they have to look things up.
And they only maintain the algorithms for like thought
and the idea of an experiment and all this cognitive glue of acting.
And this is also relevant to preventing model collapse.
Let me think.
I'm not sure.
I think it's almost like a separate axis.
It's almost like the models are way too good at our memorization and somehow we should remove that.
And I think people are much worse, but it's a good thing.
What is a solution to model collapse?
I mean, there's very naive things you could attempt.
It's just like the distribution over load just should be wider or something.
Like there's many naive things you could try.
What ends up being the problem with the naive approaches?
Yeah, I think that's a great question.
I mean, you can imagine having a regularization for entropy and things like that.
I guess they just don't work as well empirically because right now,
like the models are collapsed, but I will say
most of the tasks that we want of them don't actually demand the diversity.
It's probably the answer of what's going on.
And so it's just that the model, the frontier labs are trying to make the models useful.
And I kind of just feel like the diversity of the outputs is not so much.
Number one, it's much harder to work with an evaluate and all this kind of stuff.
But maybe it's not what's actually capturing most of the value.
It's actively penalized, right?
If you if you're like super creative in RL, it's like not good.
Yeah, or like maybe if you're doing a lot of writing, help from elements and stuff like that,
I think it's probably bad because the models will give you these like silently.
It's all the same stuff, you know, so they're not.
They won't explore lots of different ways of answering a question, right?
But I kind of feel like maybe the diversity is just not as big of a.
Yeah, maybe like, yeah, not as many applications needed so the models don't have it.
But then it's actually a problem. It's in the generation time, et cetera.
So we're actually shooting ourselves in the foot by not allowing this entropy to maintain in the model.
And I think possibly the labs should try harder.
And then I think you hinted that it's a it's a very fundamental problem.
It won't be easy to solve and what's your intuition for that?
I don't actually know if it's super fundamental.
I don't actually know if I intended to say that.
I do think that I haven't done these experiments.
But I do think that you could probably regularize the entropy to be to be higher.
So you're encouraging the model to give you more and more solutions.
But you don't want it to start deviating too much from the training data.
It's going to start making up its own language.
It's going to start using words that are extremely rare.
You know, so it's going to drift too much from the distribution.
So I think controlling the distribution is just like a tricky.
It's just like someone just has to.
It's probably not trivial in that sense.
## The Cognitive Core and Model Size

How many bits should the optimal core of intelligence end up being if you just had to make a guess?
The thing we put on the one-noim and pros.
How big does it have to be?
So it's really interesting in the history of the field because at one point,
everything was very scaling-pilled in terms of like,
oh, we're going to make much bigger models, trillions of parameter models.
And actually what the models have done in size is they've gone up.
And that was actually kind of like,
actually even come down to see if the models are smaller.
And even then, I actually think they memorized way too much.
So I think I had a prediction a while back that I almost feel like we can get cognitive course.
There are very good at even like a billion billion parameters.
It should be all very like, like if you talk to a billion parameter model, I think in 20 years,
you can actually have a very productive conversation.
It thinks and it's a lot more like a human.
But if you ask it some factual question, might have to look it up.
But it knows that it doesn't know and it might have to look it up.
And they will just do all the reasonable things.
That's actually surprising that you think it will take a billion,
because already we have a billion parameter models or a couple of billion parameter models
that are like very intelligent.
Also, our models are like a trillion parameters, right?
But they remember so much stuff like, yeah.
But I'm surprised that in 10 years, given the pace, okay,
we have a GPT OSS 20B that's way better than GPT-4 original,
which was a trillion plus parameters.
So given that trend, I'm actually surprised you think in 10 years,
the cognitive core is still a billion parameters.
I would, yeah, I'm surprised you're not like,
it's going to be like tens of millions or millions.
No, because I basically think that the training data is,
so here's the issue, the training data is the internet, which is really terrible.
So there's huge amount of gains to be made because the internet is terrible.
Like if you actually, and even the internet, when you and I think of the internet,
you're thinking of like, oh, Wall Street Journal, or that's not what this is.
When you're actually looking at a preaching data set in the Frontier Lab
and you look at a random internet document, it's total garbage.
Like I don't even know how this works at all.
It's some like stock ticker symbols.
It's a huge amount of slop and garbage from like all the corners of the internet.
It's not like your Wall Street Journal article that's extremely rare.
So I almost feel like because the internet is so terrible,
we actually have to sort of build really big models to compress all that.
Most of that compression is memory work instead of like cognitive work.
But what we really want is the cognitive part, actually delete the memory.
And then so I guess what I'm saying is like we need intelligent models
to help us refine even the pre-training set to just narrow it down to the cognitive components.
And then I think get away with a much smaller model because it's a much better data set
and you could train it on it, but probably it's not trained directly on it.
It's probably distilled for a much better model still.
But why is it distilled version still?
A billion, is I guess the thing I'm curious about?
I just feel like distillation work is extremely well.
So almost every small model, if you have a small model, it's almost certainly distilled.
Why would you train on?
No, no, why is a distillation not in 10 years not getting below one billion?
Oh, you think it should be smaller than a billion?
I mean, come on, right?
At some point, it should take at least a billion knobs to do something interesting.
You think it should be even smaller?
Yeah, I mean, just like if you look at the trend over the last few years,
just finding a little hanging fruit and going from like trillion plus models that are like
literally two orders of magnitude smaller in a matter of two years and have better performance.
Yeah, yeah, it means you think that it can sort of like core of intelligence
might be even way, way smaller, like plenty of room at the bottom to prepare for his Feynman.
I mean, I almost feel like I'm already contrarian by talking about a billion in the parameter of cognitive core
and you're out doing me.
I think, yeah, maybe we could get a little bit smaller.
I mean, I still think that there should be enough.
Yeah, maybe it can be smaller.
I do think that practically speaking, you want the model to have some knowledge.
We don't want it to be looking up everything.
Because then you can't like think in your head, you're looking up way too much stuff all the time.
So I do think it needs to be some basic curriculum needs to be there for knowledge.
But it doesn't have a certain knowledge.
So we're discussing what like plausibly could be the cognitive core.
There's a separate question, which is what will actually be the size of furniture models over time?
And here's the prediction.
So we had increasing scale up to maybe 4.5 and now we're seeing decreasing slash plateauing scale.
There's many reasons that could be going on.
But do you have a prediction about going forward?
Will the bigger models be bigger, will they be smaller, will they be the same?
Yeah, I don't know that I have a super strong prediction.
I do think that the labs are just being practical.
They have a flops budget and a cost budget.
And it just turns out that pre-chaining is not where you want to put most of your flops or your cost.
So that's why the models have gotten smaller because they are a bit smaller, the pre-chaining stages, smaller, etc.
But they make it up in the reinforcement learning and all this kind of stuff, mid-training and all this kind of stuff that follows.
So they're just being practical in terms of all the stages and how you get the most bang for the buck.
So I guess like forecasting that trend I think is quite hard.
I do still expect that there's so much longing for it.
That's my basic expectation.
And so I have a very wide distribution here.
Do you say they're looking for it to be similar in kind to the kinds of things that have been happening over the last two to five years?
Like just in terms of like if I look at Nano chat versus Nano GPT and then the architectural tweaks you made.
Is that basically like the flavor of things you continue to keep happening or is there.
You're not expecting any giant.
I expect the data sets to get much much better because when you look at the average data sets, they're extremely terrible.
So bad that I don't even know how anything works to be honest.
Look at the average example in the training set.
Like factual mistakes, errors, non-sensical things.
Somehow when you do it at scale, the noise washes away and you're left with some of the signal.
So data sets will improve a ton.
It's just everything gets better.
So our hardware, all the kernels, all the kernels for running the hardware and maximizing what you get with the hardware.
So Nvidia is slowly tuning the actual hardware itself, tenser course and so on.
All that needs to happen and will continue to happen.
All the kernels will get better and utilize the chip to the max extent.
All the algorithms will probably improve over optimization, architecture and just all of the modeling components of how everything is done and what the algorithms are that we're even training with.
So I do kind of expect like a very just everything.
Nothing dominates everything plus 20 percent.
Right.
This is like roughly what I've seen.
Okay, this is my general manager, Max.
Good to be here here every day.
And you have been here since you were onboarded about six months ago.
But when I was...
All right, time passes so fast.
But when I onboarded you, I was in France and so we basically didn't get the chance to talk at all almost.
And you basically just gave me one log in.
I gave you access to my Mercury 8 platform, which is the banking platform that I was using at the time to run the podcast.
And so I logged in Mercury assuming that that would just be the first of many steps.
But I realized that was how you were running the entire business.
Even down to a lot of our editors or international contractors.
And so you would just figure out how to set up these recurring payments to set up basic payroll.
I've been working really made the experience of all of these things I was doing before.
So seamless that it didn't even occur to me until he pointed it out.
That this is not the natural way to set up payroll or invoicing or any of these other things.
I was surprised, but I was like, it's worked so far.
So maybe I'll trust it.
And then now I can't think of doing anything else.
All right, you heard them.

Cool. Thanks, Max.

Dude, you're great at this.
I'm so nervous.
But thank you.

## Measuring Progress Toward AGI

People have proposed different ways of charting how much progress you've made towards full AGI.
Because if you come up with some line, then you can see where that line intersects with AGI and where that would happen on the X-axis.
And so people have proposed, oh, it's like the education level.
Like we had a high schooler and then they went to college with RL and they're going to get a PhD.
I don't like that one.
Or then they propose horizon length.
So maybe they can do tasks to take a minute, they can do those autonomously.
Then they can autonomously do tasks to take an hour, a human an hour, a human a week, et cetera.
How do you think about what is the relevant Y-axis here?
How should we think about how AI is making progress?
So I guess I have two answers to that.
Number one, I'm almost tempted to reject the question entirely.
Because again, I see this as an extension of computing.
Have we talked about how to chart progress in computing?
Or how do you chart progress in computing since 1970s or whatever?
What is the X-axis?
So I kind of feel like the whole question is kind of like funny from that perspective a little bit.
But I will say I guess like when people talk about AI and the original AGI and how we spoke about it when we when opening I started.
AGI was a system you can go to that can do any task that is economically valuable any economically valuable task at human performance or better.
Okay, so that was the definition and I was pretty happy with that at the time and I kind of feel like I've stuck to that definition forever.
And then people have made up all kinds of other definitions.
But I like I feel like I like that definition.
Now number one, the first concession that people make all the time is they just take out all the physical stuff.
Because we're just talking about digital knowledge work.
I feel like that's a pretty major concession compared to the original definition, which was like any task a human can do.
I can lift things etc like AI can't do that obviously.
Okay, but we'll take it.
What fraction of the economy are we taking away by saying only knowledge work?
I didn't actually know the numbers. I feel like it's about 10 to 20 percent if I had to guess is only knowledge work.
Like someone could work from home and from tasks and stuff like that.
I still think it's a really large market like what is the size of the economy and what is 10 20 percent.
We're still talking about a few trillion dollars of even in the US of market share almost or like work.
So still a very massive bucket.
But I guess like going back to the definition, I guess what I would be looking for is to what extent is the definition true.
So are there jobs or lots of tasks if we think of tasks as you know, not jobs with tasks kind of difficult.
Because the problem is like society will refactor based on the tasks that make up jobs compared to what's based on what's so automatable or not.
But today what jobs are replaceable by AI.
So a good example recently was Jeff Hinton's prediction that radiologists would not be a job anymore.
And this turned out to be very wrong in a bunch of ways.
So radiologists are alive and well and growing even though computer vision is really, really good at recognizing all the different things that they have to recognize and images.
And it's just messy complicated job with a lot of surfaces and dealing with patients and all this kind of stuff in the context of it.
So I guess I don't actually know that by that definition AI has made a huge amount of dent yet.
But some of the jobs maybe that I would be looking for have some features that I think make it very amenable to automation earlier than later.
As an example call center employees often come up and I think rightly so because call center employees have a number of simplifying properties with respect to what's automatable today.
Their jobs are pretty simple.
It's a sequence of tasks and every task looks similar like you take a phone call with a person.
It's 10 minutes of interaction or whatever it is probably a bit longer in my experience a lot longer.
And you complete some task in some scheme and you change some database entries around or something like that.
So you keep repeating something over and over again and that's your job because so basically you do want to bring in the task horizon, how long it takes to perform a task.
And then you want to also remove context like you're not dealing with different parts of services of companies or other customers is just the database you and a person you're serving.
And so it's more closed, it's more understandable and it's purely digital.
So I would be looking for those things but even there I'm not actually looking at full automation yet.
I'm looking for an autonomy slider and I almost expect that we are not going to instantly replace people.
We're going to be swapping in AIs that do 80% of the volume.
They delegate 20% of volume to humans and humans are supervising teams of five AIs doing the call center work that's more wrote.
So I would be looking for new interfaces or new companies that provide some kind of a later that allows you to manage some of these AIs they're not yet perfect.
Yeah.
And then I would expect that across the economy and a lot of jobs are a lot harder than call center employee.
I wonder with radiologists, I'm totally speculative.
I have no idea how with the actual workload of a radiologist involves.
But one analogy that might be applicable is when we was the first being ruled out there be a person sitting in the front seats and you just had to have them there to make sure that if something went really wrong.
They're there to monitor and I think even today people are still watching to make sure things are going well.
Robotaxi, who was just deployed actually still has a person inside it.
And we could be in a similar situation where if you automate 99% of a job that last 1% the human has to do is incredibly valuable because it's bottlenecking everything else.
And if it ended it had if it was the case with like with the radiologist where the person sitting in the front of the upper or the front of the way mo has to be specially trained for years in order to be able to provide the last 1%.
Their wages should go up tremendously because they're like the one the one thing bottlenecking wide deployment.
So radiologists, I think the wages have gone up for similar reasons if you're like the last bottleneck you should you're like.
And you're not fungible, which like you know a way more driver might be fungible with other things.
So you might see this thing where like your wages go like.
And then to get a 90% and then like just like that.
I see the last 1% is gone.
I see.
And I wonder if we're similar things with radiology or salaries of call center workers or anything like that.
I think that's an interesting question.
I don't think we're currently seeing that with radiology or and I don't have like in my understanding, but I think radiology is not a good example basically.
I don't know why Jeff Hinton picked on radiology because I think it's an extremely messy messy complicated profession.
So I would be a lot more interested in what's happening with call center employees today, for example, because I would expect a lot of the road stuff to be automatable today.
And I don't have a first level access to it, but maybe I would be looking for trends of what's happening with the call center and police.
Maybe some of the things I would also expect is maybe they are swapping an AI, but then I would still wait for a year or two, because I would potentially expect them to pull back and actually rehire some of the people.
I think there's been evidence that that's already been happening in the.
Generally, like companies that have been adopting AI, which I think is quite surprising.
I also find really surprising.
Okay, AGI, right, like a thing which would do everything and okay, we'll take out physical work.
So the thing which should be able to do all knowledge work and what you would not even anticipated that the way this regression happened is like you take a little task that
consultant is doing you take that out of the bucket.
You take a little task that an accountant is doing you take that out of the bucket and then you're just doing this across all knowledge work.
But instead, if we do believe we're on the path of AGI with the current paradigm, the progression is very much not like that, at least.
It just does not seem like consultants and accounts and whatever are getting like huge product of improvement.
It's very much like programmers are like getting more and more chills of the way of their work.
If you look at the revenues of these companies, discounting just like normal chat revenue, which I think is like, I don't know, that's similar to like Google or something just looking at API revenues.
It's like dominated by coding, right?
So this thing, which is general, quote unquote, which would be able to do any knowledge work.
It's just overwhelmingly doing only coding and it's a surprising way that you would expect like the AGI to be deployed.
So I think there's there's an interesting point here because I do believe coding is like the perfect first thing for these LLMs and agents.
And that's because coding has always fundamentally worked around text.
It's computer terminals and text and everything is based around text and LLMs the way they're trained on the internet, love text.
And so they're perfect text processors and there's all this data out there and it's just perfect fit.
And also we have a lot of infrastructure pre-built for handling code and text.
So for example, we have a Visual Studio code or your favorite IDE showing you code.
And then agent can plug into that. So for example, if an agent has a diff where it made some change,
we suddenly have all this code already that shows all the differences to a code base using a diff.
So we've it's almost like we've pre-built a lot of the a lot of the infrastructure for code.
Now contrast that with some of the things that that don't enjoy that at all.
So as an example, like there's people trying to build automation not for coding, but for example for slides.
Like I saw a company doing slides. That's much, much harder.
And the reason it's much, much harder is because slides are not text.
Yeah, slides are little graphics and they're arranged spatially and there's visual component to it.
And and slides don't have this pre-built infrastructure.
Like for example, if an agent used to make a different change to your slides,
how does a thing show you the diff? How do you see the diff?
There's no, there's nothing that shows diffs for slides.
So someone has to build it.
So it's just some of these things are not amenable to AIs as they are, which is text processors and code.
Surprisingly is.
I actually am not sure if that alone explains it because
I personally have tried to get elements to be useful in domains which are just pure language and language out.
Like rewriting transcripts, like coming up with clips based on transcripts, etc.
And you might say, well, it's very plausible that like I didn't do every single possible thing I could do.
I put a bunch of good examples in context, but maybe I should have done like some kind of fine tuning, whatever.
So our mutual friend Annie Matushak told me that he actually tried 50 billion things to try to get models to be good at writing space repetition prompts.
Again, very much language and language out task.
The kind of thing that should be death center in the repertoire of these all along.
And he tried in context learning obviously with a few short examples.
He tried, I think he told me like a bunch of things like supervised fine tuning and like, you know, retrieval, whatever.
And he just could not get them to make cards to a satisfaction.
So I find it striking that even in language out domains, it's actually very hard to get a lot of economic value out of these models separate from coding.
And I don't know what what explains it.
Yeah, I think I think that makes sense. I mean, I would say.
Yeah, I'm not saying that anything text is trivial.
I do think that code is like it's pretty structured.
Text is maybe a lot more flowery and this and there's a lot more like like entropy and text, I would say.
I don't know how I also put it.
And also, I mean code is hard.
And so people sort of feel quite empowered by LLM's even from like simple, simple kind of knowledge.
I basically, I don't actually know that I have a very good answer.
I mean, obviously like text makes it much, much easier. Maybe his maybe why would I put it, but it doesn't mean that all text is trivial.
## Superintelligence and Loss of Control

How do you think about super intelligence?
Do you expect it to feel qualitatively different from normal humans or human companies?
I guess I think I see it as like a progression of automation in society, right?
And again, like it's trapling the trend of computing.
I just I feel like there will be a gradual automation of a lot of things and super intelligence will be sort of like the extrapolation of that.
So I do think we expect more and more autonomous entities over time that are doing a lot of the digital work and then eventually even the physical work, probably some amount of time later.
But basically I see it as just automation, roughly speaking.
I guess automation includes the things humans can already do and super intelligence wise things humans.
Well, but some of the things that people do is invent new things, which I would just put into the automation of that makes sense.
Yeah.
But I guess maybe less abstractly and more sort of like qualitatively.
Do you expect something to feel like, okay, this because this thing can either things so fast or
has so many copies or the copies can merge back in them themselves or is quote unquote much smarter.
Any number of advantages in the eye might have.
It will qualitative the civilization in which these AIs as well just feel qualitatively different from you.
I mean, it is fundamentally automation, but I mean, it will be like extremely foreign.
I do think it will look really strange because like you mentioned, we can run all of this on the computer cluster, etc.
And much faster and all this thing.
I mean, maybe some of the scenarios, for example, that I start to get like nervous about with respect with respect to when the world looks like that is this kind of like gradual loss of control and understanding of what's happening.
And I think that's actually the most likely outcome probably is that there will be a gradual loss of understanding of
and will gradually layer all the stuff everywhere.
And there'll be fewer, fewer people who understand it and that there will be a sort of this like scenario of gradual loss of control and understanding of what's happening.
That to me seems most likely outcome of how all the stuff will go down.
Let me prove on that a bit.
It's not clear to me that loss of control and loss of understanding are the same things.
A board of directors at like, whatever, TSMC Intel name a random company.
They're just like prestigious 80 year olds. They have very little understanding and maybe they don't practically actually have control.
But actually, maybe their example is the president of the United States.
President has a lot of fucking power.
I'm not trying to make a good statement about the current operant, but maybe I am.
But like the actual level of understanding is very different from the level of control.
Yeah, I think that's fair. That's a good pushback. I think like
I guess I expect loss of both.
Yeah, outcome.
I mean, loss of understanding is obvious, but why loss of control?
So so we're really far into a territory of I don't know what this looks like.
But if I was to write sci-fi novels, they would look along the lines of not even a single entity or something like that.
So that should sort of like take over everything.
But actually, like multiple competing entities that gradually become more and more autonomous and some of them go rogue.
And the others like fight them off and all this kind of stuff.
And it's like this hot pot of completely autonomous activity that we've delegated to.
I kind of feel like it would have that flavor.
It is not the fact that they are smarter than us that is resulting in the loss of control.
It is the fact that they are competing with each other.
And whatever arises out of that competition, at least to the loss of control.
I mean, I basically expect there to be, I mean, a lot of these things, I mean, they will be tools to people.
And the people could, some of the population is like, they're acting on behalf of people or something like that.
So maybe those people are in control, but maybe it's a loss of control overall for society.
In the sense that of like outcomes we want or something like that.
Where you have entities acting on behalf of individuals, there are still kind of roughly seen as out of control.
This is a question I should have asked earlier.
So we were talking about how currently it feels like when you're doing AI engineering or AI research,
these models are more like in the category of compiler rather than in the category of a replacement.
At some point, if you have quote AGI, it should be able to do what you do.
And do you feel like having a million copies of you would parallel results in some huge speed up of AI progress?
Basically, if that does happen, would you do you expect to see an intelligence explosion or even once we have a true agent,
not talking about other loans today, but really what I mean is I do.
But it's business as usual because we're in an intelligence explosion already and have been for decades.
And when you look at Jeep, it's basically the GDP curve that is an exponential weight at some over so many aspects of the industry.
Everything is gradually being automated, has been for hundreds of years.
Industrial revolution is automation and some of the physical components and the tool building and all this kind of stuff.
Compilers are early software automation, et cetera.
So I kind of feel like we've been recursively self-improving and exploding for a long time.
Maybe another way to see it is, I mean, Earth was a pretty, I mean, if you don't look at the biomechanics and so on,
it was a pretty boring place, I think, and looked very similar if you just look from space and Earth is spinning.
And then like we're in the middle of this like firecracker event, but worse of seeing it as a motion.
But I definitely feel like this is, this has already happened for a very long time.
And again, like I don't see AI as like a distinct technology with respect to what has already been happening for a long time.
So it is, you think it's going to continue with this hyper exponential trend.
And that's why like this is, this was very interesting to me because I was trying to find AI in the GDP for a while.
I thought that GDP should go up.
But then I looked at some of the other technologies that I thought were very transformative, like maybe computers or mobile phones or et cetera.
You can't find them in GDP. GDP is the same exponential.
And it's just that even, for example, the early iPhone didn't have the app store and it didn't have a lot of the bells and whistles that the more an iPhone has.
And so even though we think of 2008 was it when iPhone came out as like some major seismic change, it's actually not.
Everything is like so spread out and so slowly diffuses that everything ends up being averaged up into the same exponential.
And it's the exact same thing with computers. You can't find them in the GDP is like, oh, we have computers vouch.
That's not what happened because it's such slow progression.
And with AI, we're going to see the exact same thing. It's just more automation.
It allows us to write different kinds of programs that we couldn't write before.
But AI is still fundamentally a program.
And it's a new kind of computer and a new kind of computing system.
But it has all these problems. It's going to diffuse over over time.
And it's still going to add up to the same exponential.
And we're still going to get an exponential that's going to get extremely vertical.
And it's going to be very foreign to live in that kind of an environment.
Are you saying that like, what will happen is if you go, if you look at the trend before the Industrial Revolution to currently,
you have a hyper exponential where you go from like 0% growth to then 10,000 years ago, 0.02% growth.
And then currently we're at 2% growth. So that's a hyper exponential.
And you're saying, if you're charting AI on there, then it's like AI takes you to 20% growth or 200% growth.
Or you could be saying, if you look at the last 300 years, what have you been seeing is you have technology after technology,
computers, electrification, steam, steam engines, railways, et cetera.
But the rate of growth is the exact same. It's 2%.
So are you saying the rate of growth will, no, I personally, I expect this, the rate of growth has also stayed roughly constant, right?
For only the last 200, 300 years. But over the course of human history, it's like exploded, right?
It's like gone from like 0% basically to like faster, faster, faster, industrial explosion, 2%.
Like basically, I guess what I'm saying is for a while, I tried to find AI or look for AI in like the GDP curve.
And I kind of convinced myself that this is false.
And that even when people talk about recursive self-improvement and labs and stuff like that, I even don't, this is business as usual.
Of course, it's going to recursively self-improve and it's been recursively self-improving.
Like LLMs allow the engineers to work much more efficiently to build the next round of LLM.
And a lot more of the components are being automated and tuned and et cetera.
So all the engineers having access to Google search is sort of part of it.
All the engineers having an ID, all of them have an autocomplete or having cloth code, et cetera.
It's all just part of the same speed up of the whole thing.
So it's just so smooth.
But just to clarify, you're saying that the rate of growth will not change.
Like, you know, the intelligence explosion will show up as like you,
it just enabled us to continue staying on the 2% growth trajectory just at the end and help us stay on the 2% growth trajectory.
Yeah, my expectation is that it stays the same pattern.
Yeah, I mean, just to throw that opposite argument against you,
my expectation is that it like blows up because I think true AGI,
and I'm not talking about LLM coding bots, I'm talking about like actual,
this is like a replacement of a human in a server is qualitatively different
from these other productivity improving technologies because it's labor itself, right?
I think we're living a very labor constrained world.
Like if we talk to any startup founder or any person, you can just be like,
okay, what do you need more of?
You just need really talented people.
And if you just have billions of extra people who are inventing stuff,
integrating themselves, making companies, bottoms, start to finish,
that feels qualitatively different from just like a single technology.
It's just sort of like just asking if we get 10 billion extra people on the planet.
I mean, maybe a counterpoint.
I mean, number one, I'm actually pretty,
pretty willing to be a convinced one way or another on this point.
But I will say, for example, computing is labor, computing was labor.
Computers like a lot of jobs disappears because computers are automating a bunch of digital
information processing that you now don't need a human for.
And so computers are labor.
And that has played out.
And you know, self-driving as an example is also like computers doing labor.
So like, I guess that's already been playing out to still business as usual.
I guess you have a machine which is spitting out more things like that at potentially faster pace.
And so we historically, we have examples of the growth version changing where like you
went from 0.2% growth to 2% growth.
So it seems very plausible to me that like a machine, which is then spitting out
the next self-driving car and the next internet and whatever.
I mean, I kind of, I see where it's coming from.
At the same time, I do feel like people make this assumption of like,
okay, we have God in the box and I can do everything.
And it's just one look like that.
It's going to be, it's going to be able to do some of the things.
It's going to fail at some other things.
It's going to be gradually put into society and basically end up with the same pattern is my prediction.
Because because this assumption of suddenly having a completely intelligent,
fully flexible, fully general human in a box and we can dispense it to arbitrary problems in society.
I don't think that we will have this like discreet change.
And and so I think we'll arrive at the same at the same kind of a gradual diffusion of this across the industry.
I think what often ends up being misleading in these conversations as people,
I don't like to use a word intelligence in this context because intelligence supplies you think like,
oh, super, super intelligence will be sitting.
There will be a single super intelligence sitting in a server and it'll like divine
how to come up with new technologies and inventions that causes this explosion.
And that's not what I'm imagining when I'm imagining 20% growth.
I'm imagining that there's billions of, you know,
basically like very smart human like minds potentially or that's all that's required.
But the fact that there's hundreds of millions of them, billions of them each individually
making new products, figuring out how to integrate themselves into the economy.
Just a way, if like a highly experienced smart immigrant came to the country,
you wouldn't need to like figure out how we integrate them in the economy.
They figured out they could start a company, they could like make inventions, you know,
or like just increase productivity in the world.
And we have examples even in the current regime of places that have had 10, 20%
in economic growth.
You know, if you just have a lot of people and less capital in comparison to the people,
you can have Hong Kong or Shenzhen or whatever, just had decades of 10% plus growth.
And I think there's a lot of really smart people who are ready to like make use of the resources
and do this like period of catch up because we've had this discontinuity.
And I think, yeah, I might be similar.
So I think I think I understand, but I still think that you're presupposing some discrete jump
that there's some unlock that we're waiting to claim.
And suddenly we're going to have geniuses and data centers.
And I still think you're presupposing some discrete jump that I think has basically no historical precedent
that I can't find in any of the statistics and that I think probably won't happen.
I mean, the answer revolution is such a jump, right?
You went from like zero percent growth, zero point two percent growth to two percent growth.
I'm just saying like you'll see another jump like that.
I'm a little bit suspicious. I would have to look at it.
I'm a little bit suspicious and I would have to take a look.
For example, like maybe some of the logs are not very good from before the industry revolution or something like that.
So I'm a little bit suspicious of it, but yeah, maybe you're right.
I don't have strong opinions.
Maybe you're saying that this was a singular event that was extremely magical.
And you're saying that maybe there's going to be another event that's going to be just like that.
Extremely magical. It will break paradigm and so on.
I actually don't think the crucial thing with the resolution was that it was not magical, right?
Like if you just zoomed in, where you would see in 1770 or 1870 is not that they're like with some key invention.
Yeah, exactly.
But at the same time, you did move the economy to a regime where the progress was much faster.
And the exponential 10x and I expect a similar thing for me.
It's not like there's going to be a single moment where we've made the crucial invention or hang that's being unlocked.
Like maybe there's a new energy source. There's there's some unlock in this case, some kind of a cognitive capacity.
And there's an overhang of cognitive cognitive work to do.
That's right. And you're expecting that overhang to be filled by this new technology went across to the threshold.
And I mean, I mean, maybe one way to think about it is through history, a lot of growth.
I mean, growth comes because people come up with ideas and people are like out there doing stuff to execute those ideas and make valuable output.
And through most of this time, population isn't exploding. That has been driving growth.
For the last 30 years, people have argued that growth is stagnated.
Population in frontier countries is also stagnated.
I think we go back on the hyper exponential growth in population and output.
Right. It's our exponential growth in population that causes hyper exponential growth and output.
Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's really hard to tell.
I understand that viewpoint. I don't intuitively feel that viewpoint.
So we just got access to Google's VO 3.1 and it's been really cool to play around with.
The first thing we did was run a bunch of problems through both VO 3 and 3.1 to see what's changing the new version.
So here's VO 3.
Hi, I'm Max and I got stuck in a local minimum again.
It's okay, Max. We've all been there.
Took me three epochs to get out.
And here's VO 3.1.
Hi, I'm Max and I got stuck in a local minimum again.
It's okay, Max. We've all been there.
Took me three epochs to get out.
V3.1's output is just consistently more coherent and the audio is noticeably higher quality.
We've been using VO for a while now, actually.
We released an essay earlier this year about AI firms fully animated by VO 2.
And it's been amazing to see how fast these models are improving.
This update makes VO even more useful in terms of animating our ideas and our explainers.
You can try VO right now in the Gemini app with pro and ultra subscriptions.
You can also access it through the Gemini API or through Google Flow.
## Evolution of Intelligence

You recommended Nick Lane's book to me and then on that basis,
I find it also super interesting and I interviewed him.
And so I actually have some questions about thinking about intelligence and evolutionary history.
Now that you, over the last 20 years of doing AI research,
you maybe have a more tangible sense of what intelligence is, what it takes to develop it.
Are you more or less surprised as a result
that evolution just sort of spontaneously stumbled upon it?
I love Nick Lane's books by the way.
Yeah, I was just listening to his podcast and way up here.
With respect to intelligence and its evolution, I do came it came fairly,
I mean, it's very, very recent, right?
I am surprised that it evolved.
I find it fascinating to think about all the worlds out there.
Like, say, there's a thousand planets like Earth and what they look like.
I think Nick Lane was here talking about some of the early parts, right?
Okay, he expects basically very similar life forms, roughly speaking and bacteria like things and most of them.
Yeah.
And then there's a few breaks in there.
I would expect that the evolution of intelligence intuitively feels to me like it should be fairly rare event
and there have been animals for, I guess maybe you should base it on how long something has existed.
So for example, the bacteria I've been around for two billion years and nothing happened.
Then going to your care, it's probably pretty hard because the bacteria actually came up quite early in Earth's evolution.
History.
And so I guess how long have we had animals?
Maybe a couple hundred million years, like multi-cellular animals that like run, run, crawl, etc.
Which is maybe 10% of Earth's lifespan or something like that.
So maybe on that time scale is actually not too tricky.
I still feel like it's so surprising to me, I think intuitively, that it developed.
I would maybe expect just a lot of animal-like life forms doing animal-like things.
The fact that you can get something that creates culture and knowledge and accumulates it is surprising to me.
Okay, so there's actually a couple of interesting follow-ups.
If you buy this sun perspective that actually the crux of intelligence is animal intelligence.
What the quote he said is, if you got to the squirrel, you'd be most of the way to AGI.
Then we got to squirrel intelligence, I guess right after the Cameroon explosion, 600 million years ago.
It seems like what instigated that was the oxygenation event 600 million years ago.
But immediately the intelligence algorithm was there to make the squirrel intelligence.
So it's suggestive that animal intelligence was like that.
As soon as you had the oxygen in the environment, you had the curiote, you could just get the algorithm.
Maybe there was an accident in the evolution of smell, it's so fast.
I don't know if that suggests actually quite at the end going to be quite simple.
Yes, basically it's so hard to tell, with any of these stuff.
I guess you can base it a little bit on how long something has a zixit or how long it feels like something has been bottlenecked.
So Nuclein is very good about describing this very apparent bottleneck in bacteria in archaea.
For two billion years nothing happened.
Extreme diversity of biochemistry and yet nothing that grows to become animals two billion years.
I don't know that we've seen exactly that kind of an equivalent with animals and intelligence to your point.
But I guess maybe we could also look at it with respect to how many times we think evolution
intelligence has like individually sprung up.
That's a really good thing to investigate.
Maybe one thought on that is I almost feel like
well, there's the hominid intelligence.
I would say like the bird intelligence, right?
Ravens, etc., extremely clever.
But their brain parts are actually quite distinct and we don't have that much existence.
So maybe that's a slight event of there's a slight indication of maybe intelligence springing up a few times.
And so in that case, you'd maybe expect it more frequently or something like that.
A former guest, Gwern, and also Carl Schlumman have made a really interesting point about that.
Which is their perspective is that the scalable algorithm which humans have and primates have,
arose in birds as well and maybe other times as well.
But in humans found a evolutionary niche which rewarded marginal increases in intelligence.
And also how to scale a little brain algorithm that could achieve those increases in intelligence.
And so for example, a bird had a bigger brain, which is like collapsed out of the air.
So it's very smart for the size of its brain, but it's like it's not an niche which rewards the brain getting bigger.
Yeah, maybe similar with some really smart dolphins, etc.
Exactly. Yeah.
Whereas humans, you know, like we have hands that like reward,
being able to learn how to do tool use, we can externalize digestion and more energy to the brain.
And that kicks off the flywheel.
Yeah. And just stuff to work with. I mean, I'm guessing it would be harder to if I was dolphin.
I mean, how do you do?
You can't have fire for example, stuff like that.
The probably like the universe of things you can do in water, like inside water is probably lower than what you can do on land.
Just chemically, right?
Yeah, I do, I do agree with this with this viewpoint of these niches and what's what's being incentivized.
I still find it's kind of miraculous that I don't I would maybe expect it things to get stuck on like animals with bigger muscles, you know,
like going through intelligence actually really fascinating breaking point.
The way where it is the reason it was so hard is is a very tight line between being in a situation where something is so important to learn.
That it's not just worth distilling the exact right circuits.
Yeah, directly back into your DNA versus it's not important enough to learn at all.
It has to be something which is like you have to to incentivize building the algorithm to learn.
You have to in lifetime.
Yeah, exactly. You have to incentivize some kind of adaptability.
You actually want something that you actually want environments that are unpredictable.
So evolution can't bake your algorithms into your weights.
A lot of a lot of animals are basically a pre-baked in this sense.
And so humans have to figure it out that test time when they get born.
And so maybe there was you actually want these kinds of environments that actually change really rapidly or simply like that where you can't foresee what will work well.
And so you actually put all that intelligence you create intelligence to figure it out the test time.
## The Intelligence Explosion Debate

So Quentin Pope had this interesting blog post where he's saying the reason he doesn't expect a sharp takeoff is
the humans at the sharp takeoff where 60,000 years ago we seem to have had the kind of architectures that we have today.
And 10,000 years ago agricultural revolution maternity dot dot dot what was happening that 50,000 years.
Well, you had to build this sort of like cultural scaffold where you can accumulate knowledge over generations.
This is an ability that exists for free in the way we do AI training.
Where if you retrain a model like in still, I mean, in many cases, they're literally distilled, but they can be trained on each other.
They can be trained on the pre-same pre-training corpus.
They don't literally have to start from scratch.
So there's a sense in which the thing which it took humans a long time to get this cultural loop going just comes for free with the way we develop training.
Yes and no, because all of them don't really have the equivalent of culture.
And maybe we're giving them way too much and incentivizing not to create it or something like that.
But I guess like the invention of culture and of written record and of like passing down notes between each other.
I don't think there's an equivalent of that with all of them right now.
So elements don't really have culture right now.
And it's kind of like one of the, I think impediments, I would say.
Can you give me some sense of what LLM culture might look like?
So in the simplest case, it would be a giant scratch pad that the LLM can edit.
And as it's reading stuff or as it's helping out work with work, it's editing the scratch pad for itself.
Why can't an LLM write a book for the other LLMs?
How would be cool?
Like why can't other LLMs read this LLM's book and be inspired by it or shocked by it or something like that?
There's no equivalence for any of this stuff.
Interesting.
When would you expect that kind of thing to start happening?
And more general question about like multi-agent systems and this sort of like independent AI.
Civilization and culture.
I think there's two powerful ideas in the realm of multi-agent that have both not been like really claimed or or so on.
The first one I would say is culture and LLMs basically a growing repertoire of knowledge for their own purposes.
The second one looks a lot more like the powerful idea of self-play in my mind is extremely powerful.
So evolution actually is a lot of competition basically driving intelligence and evolution.
And for an AlphaGo more algorithmically, like AlphaGo is playing against itself and that's how it learns to get really good at Go.
And there's no equivalent of self-playing LLMs, but I would expect that to also exist, but no one has done it yet.
Like why can't an LLM, for example, create a bunch of problems that another LLM is learning to solve?
And then the LLM is always trying to like serve more and more difficult problems, stuff like that, you know?
So like I think there's a bunch of ways to actually organize it and I think it's a realm of research.
But I think I haven't seen anything that convincingly like claims both of those like multi-agent improvements.
I still think we're mostly in the realm of a single individual agent, but I think I also think that will change and in the realm of culture also I would bucket also organizations.
And we haven't seen anything like that convincingly either.
So that's why we're still early.
And can you identify the key bottleneck that's
preventing this kind of collaboration between LLMs?
Maybe like the way I would put it is
somehow remarkably again, some of these analogies work and they shouldn't, but somehow remarkably they do.
A lot of the smaller models or the smaller models somehow remarkably resemble like a kindergarten student or then like a elementary school student or high school student, etc.
And somehow we still haven't like graduated enough where the stuff can take over.
Like it's still mostly like my cloth code or codex.
They still kind of feel like this elementary grade student.
I know that they can take PhD quizzes, but they still cognitively feel like a kindergarten or an elementary school student.
So I don't think they can create culture because they're still kids.
You know, like there's Savant kids.
They have absurd, they have perfect memory of all this stuff, etc.
And they can convincingly create all kinds of slop that looks really good.
But I still think they don't really know what they're doing and they don't really have the cognition
across all these little check boxes that we still have to collect.
Yeah.
## Lessons from Self-Driving Cars for AI Deployment

So you've talked about how you were at Tesla leading self driving from 2017 to 2022.
And then you first hand saw this progress from, we went from cool demos to now
thousands of cars out there actually autonomously doing drives.
Why did that take a decade?
Like what was happening through that time?
Yeah.
So I would say one thing I will almost instantly also push back on is this is not even you're done.
So in a bunch of ways that I'm going to get to.
I do think that self driving is very interesting because it's definitely like where I get a lot of my intuitions
because I spent five years on it.
And it has this entire history where actually the first demos of self driving go all the way to 1980s.
You can see a demo from CMU in 1986.
There's a truck that's driving itself on roads.
But okay, fast forward.
I think when I was joining Tesla, I had I had a very early demo of a Waymo.
And it basically gave me a perfect drive in 2000, 2014 or something like that.
So perfect Waymo drive a decade ago gave to us around Palo Alto and someone because I had a friend who worked there.
And I thought it was like very close and then still took a long time.
And I do think that some there's for some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on.
There's a very large demo to product gap where the demo is very easy, but the product is very hard.
And it's especially the case in cases like self driving where the cost of failures too high, right?
Many in the many industries tasks and jobs maybe don't have that property.
But when you do have that property that definitely increases the timelines.
I do think that for example in software engineering, I do actually think that that property does exist.
I think for a lot of vibe coding, it doesn't.
But I think if you're writing actual production grade code, I think that property should exist because any kind of mistake actually leads to a security vulnerability or something like that.
And millions and hundreds of millions of people's personal social security numbers, et cetera, get leaked or something like that.
And so I do think that it is a case that in software, people should be careful.
Kind of like in self driving, like in self driving, if you if things go wrong, you might get injury in.
I guess there's worse outcomes, but I guess in software, I almost feel like it's almost unbounded how terrible something could be.
So I do think that they share that property.
And then I think basically what takes them long amount of time and the way to think about it is that
it's a march of nines and every single nine is a constant amount of work.
So every single nine is the same amount of work.
So when you get a demo and something works 90% of time, that's just that's just what the first nine.
And then you need the second nine and third nine, fourth nine, fifth nine.
And while I was at Tesla for was it five years or so, I think we went through maybe three nines, two nines.
I don't know what it is, you know, but like multiple nines of iteration, they're still more nice to go.
And so that's why these things take takes so long.
And so it's definitely formative for me, like seeing something that was a demo, I'm very unimpressed by demos.
So whenever I see demos of anything, I'm extremely unimpressed by that.
It works better if you can.
If it's a demo that someone cooked up and is just showing you, it's worst.
If you can interact with it, it's a bit better, but even then you're not done.
You need actual product.
It's going to face all these challenges and when it comes in contact with reality,
know these different pockets of behavior that need patching.
And so I think we're going to see all this stuff play out.
It's a march of nines, each nine is constant, demos are encouraging.
Still a huge amount of work to do.
I do think it is a kind of a critical safety domain, unless you're doing vibe coding,
which is all nice and fun and so on.
And so that's why I think this also enforced my timelines from that perspective.
That's very interesting to hear you say that the sort of safety guarantees you need
from software, actually not dissimilar to self driving because what we'll often say is that
self driving took so long because the cost of failure is so high.
Like a human makes a mistake on average every four hundred thousand miles or every seven years.
And if you had to release a coding agent that couldn't make a mistake for at least seven years,
it would be much harder to deploy.
But I guess your point is that if you made a catastrophic coding mistake like
breaking some important system every seven years.
Very easy to do.
And in fact, in terms of sort of wall clock time, it would be much less than seven years
because you're like constantly outputting code like that, right?
So it's like per tokens or in terms of tokens, it would be seven years.
But in terms of wall clock time, it's much harder problem.
Self driving is just one of thousands of things that people do.
It's almost like a single vertical asset post,
whereas when we're talking about general software engineering, it's even more,
there's more surface area.
There's another objection people make to that analogy,
which is that with self driving, what took a big fraction of that time
was solving the problem of building basic, having basic perception that's robust
and building representations and having a model that has some common sense
so it can generalize to when it sees something that's slightly out of distribution.
If somebody's waving down the road this way, you don't need to train for it.
The thing will have some understanding of how to respond to something like that.
And these are things we're getting for free with LLMs or VLMs today.
So we don't have to solve these very basic representation problems.
And so now deploying AI across different domains will sort of be like deploying
a self driving car with current models to a different city, which is hard,
but not like a 10 year long task.
Yeah, basically I'm not 100% sure if I fully agree with that.
I don't know that we're how much we're getting for free.
And I still think there's like a lot of gaps in understanding in what we are getting.
And we're differently getting more generalizable intelligence in a single entity.
Whereas self driving is a very special purpose task that requires in some sense,
building a special purpose task is maybe even harder in a certain sense,
because it doesn't like fallout from a more general thing that you're doing at scale.
That makes sense.
So, but I still think that the analogy doesn't, I still don't know if it fully resonates
because like the LLMs are still pretty fallible.
And I still think that they have a lot of gaps and that still needs to be filled in.
And I don't think that we're getting like magical generalization completely out of the box,
sort of in a certain sense.
And the other aspect that I want to also actually return to when I was in the beginning was
self driving cars are newer and are down still.
So even though so the deployment still are pretty minimal, right?
So even Waymo and so on has very few cars.
And they're doing that roughly speaking because they're not economical, right?
Because they've built something that that lives in the future.
And so they had to pull back future, but they had to make it un-economical.
So they have all these costs, not just marginal costs for those cars
and their operation and maintenance, but also the capex of the entire thing.
So making the economical is still going to be a slog, I think, for them.
And then also I think when you look at these cars and there's no one driving,
I also think it's a little bit deceiving because there are actually very elaborate
tele-operation centers of people actually kind of like in a loop with the scars.
And I don't have the full extent of it, but I think there's more human in a loop that you might expect.
And there's people somewhere out there basically beaming in from the sky.
And I don't actually know they're fully in the loop with the driving.
I think some of the times they are, but they're certainly involved and there are people.
And in some sense we haven't actually removed the person we've like moved them to somewhere we can't see them.
I still think there will be some work as you mentioned going from environment to environment.
And so I think like there's still challenges to make self-driving real.
But I do agree that it's definitely cross a threshold where it kind of feels real,
unless it's like really to operate it.
For example, Waymo can't go to all the different parts of the city.
My suspicion is it's like parts of city where you don't get a good signal.
Anyway, so basically I don't actually know anything about the stack.
I mean, I'm just making up. Make outside.
Surely you let's love driving for five years of Tesla.
Sorry, I don't know anything about the specifics of Waymo.
I'll talk about them.
I actually, by the way, love Waymo and I take it all the time.
So I don't want to say like sure.
I just think that people again are sometimes a little bit too naive about some of the progress.
And I still think there's a huge amount of work.
And I think Tesla took in my mind a lot more scalable approach.
And I think the team is doing extremely well and it's going to.
And I I'm kind of like on the record for predicting how this will go.
Which is like Waymo had like early start because you can package up so many sensors.
But I do think Tesla is taking the more scalable strategy and it's going to look a lot more like that.
So I think this will have to still play out and hasn't.
But basically like, I don't want to talk about self-driving or something that took a decade because it didn't take.
It didn't take yet.
That makes sense.
Because one, it's the start is at 1980, not 10 years ago, and then two, the end is not here yet.
Yeah, the end is not not near yet because when we're talking about self-driving, usually in my mind, it's self-driving at scale.
Yeah.
People don't have to get a driver's license, et cetera.
Bounce to other ways in which the analogy might be different.
And the reason I'm especially curious about this is because I think the question of how fast AI is deployed,
how valuable it is when it's early on is like potentially the most important question in the world right now.
Like if you're trying to model what the year or 20 or 30 looks like, this is the question you want to have some understanding of.
So another thing you might think is one, you have this latency requirement with self-driving
where you have, I have no idea what the actual models are, but I assume like tens of millions of parameters or something, which is not the necessary constraint for knowledge work with LLMs.
Or maybe it might be with the computer use and stuff, but anyways, the other big one is maybe more importantly, on this CapEx question, yes, there is additional cost to serving up an additional copy of a model.
But the sort of op-ex of a session is quite low and you can amortize the cost of AI into the training run itself, depending on how inference scaling goes and stuff.
But it's certainly not as much as like building a whole new car to serve another instance of a model.
So it's just the economics of deploying more widely are much more favorable.
I think that's right. I think if you're sticking in a realm of bits, bits are like a million times easier than anything that touches the physical world.
I definitely grant that.
Bits are completely changeable, arbitrarily reshuffleable at a very rapid speed.
So you would expect a lot more faster adaptation, also in the industry and so on.
And then what was the first one?
The Lindsay requirements.
I think that's roughly right. I mean, I also think that if we are talking about knowledge work at scale, there will be some latency requirements practically speaking because we, you know, we're going to have to make create a huge amount of compute and serve that.
And then I think like the last aspect that I very briefly want to also talk about is like all the all the rest of it, just all the rest of it.
So what the society think about it, what is the legal around how is it working legally?
How is it working insurance wise?
Who's really like what is the, what are those layers of it and aspects of it?
What happens with what is the equivalent of people putting a cone on the way?
Yeah, you know, there's going to be equivalents of all that.
And so I do think that I almost feel like self-strapping is a very nice analogy that you can borrow things from.
Yeah, what is the equivalent of the cone on the car?
What is the equivalent of a teleoperating worker who's like hidden away?
And almost like all the aspects of it.
Yeah, do you have any opinions on whether this implies that the current day I build out, which would like 10X the amount of available compute in the world and a year or two and maybe like 100 more than 100 exit by the end of the decade.
If the use of AI will be lower than some people in the early predict, does that mean that we're overbuilding compute or do is that a separate question?
Kind of like what happened with railroads and all this kind of stuff.
Was it railroads?
Sorry, it was.
Yeah, there is like a historical precedent or was it with telecommunication industry, right?
Like prepaving the internet that only came like a decade later, you know, and creating like a whole bubble in the telecommunications industry in the late 90s kind of thing.
Yeah.
So I don't know.
I mean, I understand I'm sounding very pessimistic here.
I'm only doing that.
I'm actually optimistic.
I think this will work.
I think it's tractable.
I'm only sounding pessimistic because when I go on my Twitter timeline, I see all the stuff.
That makes no sense to me.
And and I think there's a lot of reasons for why that exists and I think a lot of it is I think honestly just fundraising.
It's just incentive structures.
A lot of it may be fundraising.
A lot of it is just attention, you know, converting attention to money on the internet, you know, stuff like that.
So I think there's a lot of that going on and I think I'm only reacting to that.
But I'm still like overall very bullish on technology.
I think we're going to work through all this stuff and I think there's been a rapid amount of progress.
I don't actually know that there's over building.
I think that there's going to be we're going to be able to go up what in my understanding has been built.
Because I do think that, for example, Cloud Code or opening a codex and stuff like that, they didn't even exist a year ago.
Right. Is that right?
I think it's roughly right.
This is miraculous technology that didn't exist.
I think there's going to be a huge amount of demand as they're as we see the demand in charge of it, he already and so on.
So yeah, I don't actually know that there's over building, but I guess I'm just reacting to like some of the very fast timelines that people continue to say incorrectly.
And I've heard many, many times over the course of my 15 years in AI were very reputable people keep getting this wrong all the time.
And I think I want us to be properly calibrated and I think some of this also it does have like geopolitical ramifications and things like that when
like some of these questions and I think I don't want people to make mistakes on that on that sphere of things.
So I do want us to be grounded in reality of what technology is and isn't.
