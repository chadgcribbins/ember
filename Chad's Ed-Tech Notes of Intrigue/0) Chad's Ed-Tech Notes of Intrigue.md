# Chad's Ed-Tech Notes of Intrigue  
  
So his is the piece I wrote after being inspired by how AI can change education for good. It talks about my experience at Black Butte School as a kid that probably saved my life: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chadcribbins_is-an-educational-transformation-wave-cresting-activity-7308047584340631554-Lyby](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chadcribbins_is-an-educational-transformation-wave-cresting-activity-7308047584340631554-Lyby)

- Nils, the founder of Artemis has moved to Tanzania the base of Mount Kilimanjaro, where his kids are in school that stops at eight and Tim school will be the following on education from high school nine1011 and 12 so there could be an interesting connection there between Tim and Artemis.   
- Tim has a project called the Humin university or he’s trying to set up a curriculum that makes people more switched onto the EQ and so he’s trying to build that out and he asked if I want to play a role that.

The founder story is epic. This company has had one of the fastest growth trajectories in history, and one day a billion-dollar company will be created by a solo founder—it might have just started in this ecosystem first.

[callee ☾ on Instagram: "If you know me, you know I’m weary of AI 😅 but even it knows these truths:

Raise children to QUESTION authority. Not to obey blindly. Not to trust a system that feeds them pills, screens, and processed food while stripping them of their intuition. Give them tech as a tool .. not a master. Let them get bored so they can remember who they are. Let mother nature guide them not systems. Teach them that their body is their own, their mind belongs to no one, and dependence is the fastest way to be controlled.

That’s why we walked away.

We left behind the noise, the “normal” life — and hit the road with our baby, because we refused to let the world program him before he ever had a chance to know himself. We wanted him to wake up with the sun, eat food grown from the earth, live close to his parents, and learn through living .. not indoctrination.
