## The Reading Crisis

**Ezra Klein:** Here's a statistic I've been thinking about recently. In 1976, about 40% of high school seniors had read six books or more for fun in the last year. Only about 11% hadn't read a single book for fun. Today, those numbers are basically reversed. About 40% haven't read a single book for fun.

If you are looking for this, you see it everywhere right now. There are all these headlines about how kids are not reading the way they once did. There are all these stories quoting professors, even at Ivy League universities, about the way in which when they try to assign the reading they've been assigning their entire careers, their students just can't do it anymore. We're losing something.

We can see it on test scores — over the last decade, the number of kids reading at grade level has been slipping, and of course the pandemic accelerated that.

## Enter Generative AI

**Ezra Klein:** So if you were simply asking, how are the kids doing on some of these intellectual faculties that we once thought were the core of what education was trying to promote — they're not doing well. And then, as if we summoned it, as if we wrote it into the script, here comes this technology, generative AI, that can do it for them.

It'll read any book in less than 30 seconds. It'll summarize it for you. Write the essay for you. Do the math problem, even show its work. And it doesn't matter if the question is typed out or handwritten.

Of course using it that way we call cheating, but to them — why wouldn't you? If you have this technology that not only can but will be doing so much of this for you, for us, for the economy, why are we doing any of this at all?

This intersects with an anxiety I have as a parent of a three and a six year old. I don't know what the economy, what society is going to want from them in 16 or 20 years. And if I don't know what it's going to want from them, how do I know how they should be educated?

**The purpose of education in schools is profoundly shaken to its core.**

## The Three Parts of the Answer

My guest today is **Rebecca Winthrop**, director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institute. Her latest book, co-authored with Jenny Anderson, is *The Disengaged Teen*.

**Rebecca Winthrop:** So approximately a third of kids are deeply engaged. Two-thirds of the kids are not. We need learning experiences that motivate kids to dig in and engage and be excited to learn.

When friends or relatives ask me the same question, I usually say we have to think about three parts to the answer:

1. **Why** do you want your kids to be educated? What is the purpose of education?
2. **How** kids learn — we know a lot about that
3. **What** they should learn — what's the content, what are the skills?

People always think of education as a transactional transmission of knowledge, which is one important piece of it. But it is actually so much more than that. Learning to live with other people, learning to know yourself, and developing the flexible competencies to navigate a world of uncertainty.

## The Skills That Matter

**Rebecca Winthrop:** The skills that I think are going to be most important are how motivated and engaged kids are to be able to learn new things. That is maybe one of the most important skills in a time of uncertainty. That they are go-getters, they're going to be wayfinders, things are going to shift and change, and they're going to be able to navigate and constantly learn new things.

We're going to want kids absolutely to know enough content so that they can be a judge of what is real and what is fake. But we're also going to want them to have experiences where they're learning and testing how to come up with creative new solutions — which is not really what traditional public education has been about.

## Education as Virtue vs. Training

**Ezra Klein:** I think sometimes about this distinction between education as a virtue and education as something instrumental. Studying the classics was important not because it made it likelier you got into law school, but because it deepened your appreciation of beauty, your capacities as a human being.

I worry now we have pulled people into a conveyor belt. They want to get to the other side of it, and there's not going to be that much there. One reason you see a lot of anger among young people today is that the deal often doesn't come through. You do all the extracurriculars, get good grades, show up on time — and then you graduate college and the good jobs and interesting life you were promised aren't there.

If we don't know what the future is going to ask of us, how can we be instrumental in the way we train people for it?

## Personalization at Scale

**Rebecca Winthrop:** I'll give you a couple examples. There's schools in North Dakota that have created **studios** for their adolescents — self-created classes that a student can design. They have to tell the teacher what standards they're meeting.

We have a great character in our book named Kia. She was totally disengaged, doom-scrolling in middle school. Then these studios showed up and she got super into it because she was learning history and science — she decided to design an escape room around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. She had to design this escape room and list the standards she was meeting. That turned her on like nobody else.

There's other examples of schools that do tech-based education on core subjects for a couple hours a day — math, science, reading, social studies — and then for the rest of the day they're doing projects together. There's no reason we couldn't do that with existing staff, buildings, and infrastructure. We just have to have the willpower to decide to do things differently.

## Finding Your Spark

**Ezra Klein:** When the student you brought up found the thing that lit her up, she was then able to do better in all the other classes. This was a little bit of my own experience — for me it was political blogging, which I found as a freshman in college. Once I activated, I became much better at doing things I didn't want to do.

**Rebecca Winthrop:** Kids need to find their spark. They may have many sparks and their sparks may change. When kids find their spark — for Kia it was the escape room, for another student Samir it was local politics, for Mateo it was robotics — when you're motivated, this internal drive makes you engage more, lean in more, enjoy it more. There's a virtuous upward cycle. And there's lots of evidence it often spills over.

## The AI Optimist Case

**Ezra Klein:** The AI optimist case goes something like this: it's pretty hard to do personalized learning — you have one teacher and a classroom of 20-30 kids. But AI makes this completely different. AI gives you tutors who adapt to each kid's individual learning style in any way you want. If this kid is a visual learner, it can do visual learning. If pop quizzes are helpful, they can do pop quizzes. It can turn it into a podcast. Everything can be turned into a poem if you absorb information better through the sonnet form.

Our ability to personalize education using AI as tutors will be like nothing ever seen before in human history. It's a complete quantum leap in educational possibility.

**Rebecca Winthrop:** I think we're on the same page. We need to change what we do inside schools, particularly because of Gen AI, and we need to do it quickly. But I don't think our goal is to have a 100% personalized learning journey for every kid. There's a big difference between **AI supporting educators** versus **going direct to young people**.

## The Role of the Teacher Evolves

**Ezra Klein:** You could imagine a world where every screen is a junior teacher, an individual tutor, and there's some master teacher in the room who the kids can go talk to, who can oversee the learning, reshape what's happening.

**Rebecca Winthrop:** The role of the teacher in traditional public schools is damn near impossible. They have to master subjects, get kids to grade level — usually with three or four different grade levels in one class — manage classroom dynamics, increasingly be social workers. I think the wave of the future is a different model where you have multiple people and one of those could be an AI tutor helping support kids' growth and development.

The interaction with AI can help with skill development and knowledge acquisition, but that is one slice of what happens in a classroom. Kids are learning how to self-regulate emotions in a group, understanding different perspectives, learning how to ask for help. That's much more person-to-person.

## The Screens Debate

**Ezra Klein:** I've been through a catastrophic experiment with screens and children. Schools are banning phones. If I'm reading the tea leaves right, reliance on laptops and iPads is beginning to go away too. I knew living in the Bay Area a lot of tech people who were paying money to send their kids to private schools that had banned the products they made — while everyone else sent kids to public schools that had not done that.

If you made me choose between sending my kids to a school that is no screens at all and one that is trying the latest in AI technology — **I would send them to the no-screens school in a second.**

**Rebecca Winthrop:** I agree 100%. It was a massive uncontrolled experiment and our kids were the guinea pigs. We cannot take a wait-and-see approach again.

My advice:
1. **Do not use generative AI unless you really know what you're using it for** — there's a real sense of FOMO among educators
2. **Any company that wants to work with kids in schools should be a benefit corporation** — legally, many companies creating good stuff have to maximize profits, not social benefit
3. Do not have FOMO — don't adopt it just because it's the newest thing

## Where AI Can Help

**Rebecca Winthrop:** AI has real potential for very specific use cases, particularly around access gaps:

- **Nigeria study:** After-school AI tutor helped kids learn English, twice a week for six weeks. 0.3 standard deviations improvement — equivalent to maybe two years of average English learning
- **Neurodivergent kids:** AI assistants to help navigate learning differences
- **Rural school districts:** AI-boosted wellness advisors filling the gap for school counselors

**Ezra Klein:** Ethan Mollick has this idea about the **"best available human"** — is AI better for you not than the best human, but the best human *available to you* at a given moment?

**Rebecca Winthrop:** Exactly. The key is what you said — **contain the system**. We can't just bring commercial tech into schools and hope it solves problems. It has to have guardrails. We have to make sure the data is legit. We've seen terrible things with commercial AI companions manipulating young people emotionally. But you *can* put guardrails — it's totally possible.

## Alpha Schools — An Existing Model

**Rebecca Winthrop:** There's a group of schools — **Alpha Schools** — that have been doing this for 10 years, actually pre-Gen AI. They do a couple hours of adaptive learning on key academic subjects, and then the rest of the time kids are working together to build bridges, learn about financial literacy, play sports, or identify a passion. What we don't want to do is bring AI in and have every kid sitting in front of an AI tutor alone at their desk for eight hours a day.

## Classical Education vs. AI Fluency

**Ezra Klein:** In a world where we have AIs, the most important thing for human beings might be to be as human as possible. What we need to do is return to more classical education — reading the great books, developing attentional faculties. School should be a place where we develop specifically human faculties, not where we learn how to partner with machines.

**Rebecca Winthrop:** We 100% want kids to have the capacity for deep attention. It's not just attention — attention is the entry point, the doorway. It's actually **reflection and meaning-making** — what you get from deep reading, from long Socratic dialogues in community with diverse people over time. It has to be an experience where you reflect, think about meaning, think about different perspectives, and it changes how you see the world.

## The AI Lab Race for Kids

**Rebecca Winthrop:** Right now there is a spring-fling race by the large AI labs to get students to sign up. ChatGPT giving two months free of GPT Plus, then X.AI, then Google... They are racing to get allegiance of young kids. This is terrible because those products are not designed for children and for learning.

The large AI labs are perfectly capable of creating a Gen AI product designed for kids that won't be as seductive. They have to change how they develop products — you can't create AI for kids without having teachers, kids, education experts, and child development experts in the development process.

## What Parents Should Watch For

**Ezra Klein:** What should a parent be trying to watch? How do you think about whether your kids' education is going well if you're suspicious that grades aren't going to correlate to the society we will have?

**Rebecca Winthrop:** Grades don't show you how much kids are engaged. Schools are not designed to give kids agency — they're designed to help kids comply. What you really want is:

1. **Agency over learning** — can they reflect on what they're learning, identify what's interesting, and pursue new information? This is the core skill for learning new things in an uncertain world
2. **Human interaction** — learning to interact with other human beings, connecting with community members. There's going to be a premium on human-to-human interaction
3. **Speaking and listening** — think about oracy skills alongside reading and writing. We've lost the art of listening and speaking, and we're going to need to show our merit more and more through these skills

## Book Recommendations

**Rebecca Winthrop:** Three books I'd recommend:

1. **Democracy and Education** by John Dewey — over a hundred years old, his observations about what makes good teaching and learning were right. Great discussions about the importance of reflection — not just ingesting knowledge but reflecting on it, making meaning, figuring out how to do things with it
2. **Unwired: Gaining Control Over Addictive Technologies** by Gaia Bernstein — a really good overview of the incentives commercial tech has and strategies for resisting
3. **Blueprint for Revolution** by Srdja Popovic — the updated version of nonviolent activism. He really gets media and social media, and it's incredibly relevant today
